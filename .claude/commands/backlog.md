description: Reconcile GitHub issues with reality and keep the ready queue dependency-ordered, consulting the user personas for API/CLI-facing work. Doc-only commit; no code changes.
---

Delegate to the **cartographer** for its full /backlog pass: survey
reality, reconcile the issue list against it, reconcile the branch
namespace, and **rewrite docs/PLAN.md's Status section by replacement** —
lane scores read from `conformance/testdata/expectations/*.txt`, milestone
and queue counts read from GitHub, one date stamp for the section, and the
next planning action named. Replace it; never leave the previous version
beside the new one.

For API- or CLI-facing milestones, **you** — this session, not the
cartographer — delegate to **libuser** and **cliuser**, giving each only
the README and `go doc` output, then hand their reports to the
cartographer to fold into issue bodies. A cartographer subagent cannot
spawn them, and it has already read the source, so a persona it
role-played itself would launder an insider's opinion as an outsider's
(#416).

Then delegate a log entry to **chronicler**, commit as
`meta: backlog <date>`, and land it by opening a PR and squash-merging it
in this same session — never leave the commit on an unmerged branch. No
code changes in this trigger.
