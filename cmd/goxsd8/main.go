const usage = `goxsd8 — XSD 1.1 schema compilation, instance validation, and code generation.

Usage (contract; subcommands land with their milestones):

  goxsd8 parse [-q] [-v] <schema.xsd>...
      Compile each schema argument and print its summary on stdout:
      the argument as it was spelled, then a block of lines indented
      two spaces and spelled "<label>: <value>". A namespace: line
      for each distinct namespace of the components the compilation
      declares (the argument document and every one it includes,
      imports, overrides or redefines) comes first, in
      first-appearance order and none when it declares nothing.
      Then one count per kind of declaration those documents make,
      all seven kinds always and always in this order: types,
      elements, attributes, attribute groups, model groups,
      notations, identity constraints. types counts the simple and
      the complex definitions together on the one line; model groups
      counts the top-level <xs:group> definitions; and the
      components: line closing the block is the sum of those seven,
      which no namespace line is counted into. Each argument is its
      own root document and its own run, in argument order — several
      arguments are several compilations, not one set.
      Exit 0 when every one compiles; 1 when any is rejected, its
      first error on stderr as <loc>: [<rule>] <message> (assembly
      stops there, so a rejected schema is one error line); 2 when an
      argument cannot be read, which is never a verdict about a
      schema. The exit code is the worst of those outcomes.
      An <xs:include>, <xs:import>, <xs:override> or empty
      <xs:redefine> whose schemaLocation resolves to no document is
      named on stderr at its own position, with no rule ID and no
      change of exit code: the skip is legal, so the summary above is
      printed off a schema short of whatever that document declares.
      -q does not silence it. A bare <xs:import>, which names no
      document, is not reported. A REJECTED schema is named the same
      way, for the directives assembly reached before it stopped, in
      a line saying the assembly was rejected rather than compiled
      and saying nothing about whether the unread document had a part
      in that.

  goxsd8 validate -schema <schema.xsd> [-schema <s2>]... <instance>...
      Assess instances against the compiled set; every schema needs
      its own -schema, and every positional argument is an instance.
      The -schema documents compose into ONE set — several of them are
      one compilation, not one each — and - names standard input as an
      instance, never as a schema.
      A -schema document's own unresolved directive is named on
      stderr the same way, once for the set, before any instance is
      assessed — and when the set does not compile, for whichever
      documents the assembly reached, so one document's rejection
      does not silence another's shortfall.
      Source format by extension (.xml, .json, .ber) or forced with
      -format xml|json|ber, matched case-sensitively and applying to
      every instance of the invocation (there is no per-instance
      spelling); an unrecognized token, and an instance whose
      extension names none of the three, are usage errors listing the
      values. Only xml is assessed today: json and ber are reserved,
      and an instance in either exits 2 saying so.
      xsi:schemaLocation hints on the document element of an XML
      instance augment the schema set for that instance (resolved
      relative to the instance; disable with -no-hints). A hint the
      set will not compose with is the instance's own fault, not
      the schema set's: it is reported on stderr naming that
      instance, whose hints are then dropped, and it is assessed
      against the -schema documents alone.
      Exit 0 when no instance was charged a violation and none left
      a check undecided, 1 invalid, 2 usage/IO, and
      3 when the schema set does not compile. 4 is an instance the
      assessment declined to decide: no violation charged, and a
      check it reached not performed, so the instance stands
      undecided against the rule that check answers to rather than
      clean. The code is the worst outcome over the instances, by
      severity and not by number: undecided is less severe than
      invalid, so a run holding one of each exits 1, and 4 answers a
      run where something was left undecided and nothing was worse.
      Every instance is assessed — the run never stops at the first
      invalid one — and each violation, and each check the assessment
      declined, prints one line on stdout:
      <loc>: [<rule>] <message>.

  goxsd8 gen -schema <schema.xsd> -out <dir> [-schema <s2> -out <d2>]... [-backend strict|native]
      Generate Go types; repeated -schema/-out pairs map schemas to
      output directories (multiple schemas, multiple output dirs).
      Exit 0 when every pair is generated; 1 when a schema is
      rejected, its first error on stderr as <loc>: [<rule>]
      <message>; 2 when an argument cannot be read, an output
      directory cannot be written, or a -schema stands without its
      -out. The exit code is the worst of those outcomes. Those are
      the codes gen answers with once M9 builds it: until then every
      gen invocation exits 2, reporting that gen is not yet
      implemented.

Flags common to all subcommands: -q (quiet), -v (debug logging via
slog to stderr; scope with GOXSD_DEBUG=parser,validate,codec). They
qualify a subcommand and follow its name — goxsd8 parse -q a.xsd, not
goxsd8 -q parse a.xsd. -q suppresses a subcommand's informational
output, which is parse's summary, and never a diagnosis: neither the
error lines above nor validate's violations and undecided checks are
silenced by it.

Implemented today: the help path, parse and validate. With no arguments,
or with -h, -help or --help in any argument position, goxsd8 prints this
usage to stdout and exits 0. goxsd8 parse compiles its arguments as above
and honours -q and -v; goxsd8 validate assesses XML instances as above and
honours -v, -q silencing nothing there because it writes no informational
output. GOXSD_DEBUG scopes -v for neither. Every other invocation exits 2,
reporting on stderr that gen is reserved but not yet implemented, that the
name is not one of the three, that a help request carries a value, that a
flag stands before the subcommand it qualifies, or that the first argument
is a flag and no subcommand was given.
