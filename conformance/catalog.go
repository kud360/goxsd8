// This file is the catalog READER (issue #1642): it answers which case IDs
// name a given suite document, for a caller that holds fixture paths and needs
// the IDs conformance/testdata/expectations/<lane>.txt is keyed by. It runs no
// case and decides nothing — parseSuite and everything under it are untouched
// by it, and a reader's answer never reaches a lane's score.
//
// It is a SECOND walk over the same catalog, not a second reading of it. Every
// fact it reports comes from the runner's own primitives — caseID, caseDocs,
// groupSchemaDocs, versionApplicable and resolveExpected — so the ID it hands
// out is the ID makeCase stamps, by construction and not by agreement (STYLE
// D3). What differs is the traversal: casesFromSet stops descending at the
// level that withheld a case and produces nothing for it, because a case the
// suite scoped away is not this processor's to run; a reader of the catalog
// must report that entry anyway, since its ID is a real catalog entry that
// merely carries no line in any lane. The two also differ on a malformed
// entry: casesFromSet ends the run, and the reader reports the entry with no
// document rather than refusing to describe the catalog it was asked about.
//
// Those two divergences are the whole of it, and nothing about the traversal
// is left to agreement: TestCatalogAgreesWithDiscoveryOverThePinnedSuite
// asserts, over the pinned suite, that the IDs of the entries this reader
// does NOT mark withheld are exactly parseSuite's produced cases and that the
// ones it marks are exactly parseSuite's withheld list. A set that drifts is
// a lane figure quoted from a catalog the runner does not have.
//
// The one thing the reader will not do is fabricate a DECLARED OUTCOME.
// makeCase refuses a test declaring no <expected> at all, and catalogEntry
// refuses the same test at the same level of applicability, because
// DeclaredValid has no encoding for "nothing declared" — false there would
// read as "declared invalid" and reach the join's #1561 subtraction as a
// fact. A WITHHELD entry declaring nothing is reported, since discovery
// withholds it without reading its declaration either.

// suiteIndexIn names the suite index inside a suite checkout — the file whose
// absence means the submodule is not initialized. It is the ONE construction
// of that name (STYLE D3): suitePath takes it over the package-relative
// suiteRoot, Catalog over whatever directory its caller names.

//
// Its consumer is tools/casejoin, which turns a tools/suiteindex census of
// fixture paths into the case IDs CLAUDE.md's ratchet-prediction join runs
// against (STYLE T5). It is a plain record because it is a REPORT: every field
// is a fact read off the catalog, and nothing downstream may construct one and
