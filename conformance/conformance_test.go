// TestConformance runs the W3C suite through the lane executors and enforces
// the ratchet, per conformance/doc.go.
//
//   - Submodule absent: fail with a pointer to `git submodule update --init`
//     (issue #309), unless a read-only run explicitly opted out with
//     GOXSD_SUITE_OPTIONAL=1. A run that executed zero cases must never be
//     mistaken for a green one, and the opt-out never covers a ratchet run.
//   - Read-only (default): Compare each lane's observed run against its
//     committed expectations and fail only on a Regressed case; New/Improved/
//     Vanished do not fail the read-only run (doc.go "Running"). Improved is
//     logged so an agent that cannot run the ratchet can still see the upward
//     movement its branch earned but has not banked (issue #303).
//   - Every lane, on either path, reports its decline census (issue #327): the
//     count of recorded failures no executor decided at all, re-checked this run
//     rather than trusted. GOXSD_DECLINES=1 also lists their IDs.
//   - Sanctioned applicability removals — cases discovery withheld because the
//     suite's own metadata scopes them away from this processor (issue #576) —
//     are logged on the read-only path and never fail it.
//   - GOXSD_RATCHET=1: additionally Ratchet each lane and rewrite its file;
//     a Ratchet refusal (regression, vanished, or a removal count the run did not
//     assert) fails the test. Arbiter only. Writing is all-or-nothing across
//     lanes (ratchetAll, issue #581): every lane merges first, and one lane's
//     refusal leaves every lane's file untouched.
//   - GOXSD_RATCHET_REMOVALS=<lane>=<n>,…: arbiter-only, ratchet-path-only
//     assertion of the sanctioned removals each lane is expected to bank; set
//     without GOXSD_RATCHET=1 it fails the run rather than half-applying.
//   - GOXSD_CASE=<id>: narrow execution to one case across all lanes.
//
// At M1 no real executor is registered, so every case is a stub Fail and, with
// empty committed lane files, every case is New — the read-only run passes.
