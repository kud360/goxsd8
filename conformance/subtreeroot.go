// This file holds the instance lane's one shape gate for the "valid"
// observation: an ASSESSED SUBTREE ROOT (#1841), a validation root, with or
// without content (#1855), whose every element the walk strictly assessed
// against a type it really has, through a declaration, through an xsi:type for
// a wildcard's child resolving none (#1978) or for a root resolving none
// (#2156), or through its ·locally declared type· or an xsi:type ·overriding·
// it for an {open content}'s child with one (#2080), or laxly assessed against
// ·xs:anyType· (#1911), and every attribute against its ·governing attribute
// declaration· where it has one (key-sva clause 2), with no clause of key-sva
// (§3.3.4.6), cvc-elt (§3.3.4.3), cvc-type (§3.3.4.4) or cvc-complex-type
// (§3.4.4.2) left undecided unrecorded. instance.go's "Why an EMPTY Result is
// evidence of validity for ONE shape only" states which clause each condition
// discharges; this file is only the conditions.
//
// The gate is computed per case and stored nowhere. It re-reads the instance
// with internal/xmltok, decoding a byte-order-marked UTF-16 document and admitting
// a 1.x version label as parser/xmltree does (rawDecoder), and re-derives every
// child's ·attribution· through xsd.Schema.ContentMatcher, independently of the
// walk, so it never rests on what the walk did or did not record for a
// descendant — save for a strict ·wildcard particle·'s child resolving to no
// declaration and carrying no xsi:type, which it admits unread because the walk
// charges that child's parent for it (subtreeGate.resolvedChild).

// versioningNS is the XML Schema versioning namespace §4.2.2 reads vc:minVersion,
// vc:maxVersion, vc:typeAvailable, vc:typeUnavailable, vc:facetAvailable and
// vc:facetUnavailable from. parser keeps its own copy unexported; the lane

// Appendix F.1): a UTF-16 document, either byte order, is transcoded to UTF-8,
// a UTF-8 mark is dropped as the encoding signature it is, and an encoding
// declaration that disagrees with the mark fails the read through the mark's
// CharsetReader. The mark is thereby consumed before xmldecl.As10 meets the
// declaration, as As10 requires, and As10 then admits a 1.x version label as
// xmltree admits it — so a document's label is admitted here exactly when
// xmltree admits it, in either encoding, with the mark or without.
//
// One disagreement xmltree rejects is read here: a UTF-16 mark under
// encoding="UTF-8", which encoding/xml never hands to a CharsetReader and
// xmltree's checkDeclaration catches on its own. No verdict rests on that

// instance through xmltree, and a case whose instance instanceHints read is
