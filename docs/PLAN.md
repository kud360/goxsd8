# goxsd8 Roadmap

**This file is status, not history.** It says where the project stands and
what each milestone is for. It does not narrate how it got there — that is
`docs/LOG/` — and it is not the work queue: GitHub issues are, and the
milestone links below go to the live lists.

Milestones map one-to-one to GitHub milestones. The cartographer carves
each into session-sized `ready` issues; the develop loop closes them one
per landing. Prefer vertical slices that move a conformance lane over
horizontal completeness.

**The Status section is REPLACED, never appended to.** `/backlog` rewrites
it wholesale from the sources — `go tool lanestatus` for the lane scores,
GitHub for milestone and queue counts — and stamps it with the date it
read them. One stamp for the whole section, so a reader can tell staleness
from wrongness at a glance. Never add a dated paragraph beside the old
one — appending is what this replaces.

## Status — 2026-08-09

Conformance lanes — **paste `go tool lanestatus` verbatim**, never a
hand-count:

| Lane | Pass | Fail | Total |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `ber` | — | — | 0 |
| `datatypes` | 1156 | 17 | 1173 |
| `instance` | 0 | 26361 | 26361 |
| `json` | — | — | 0 |
| `schema` | 9635 | 5763 | 15398 |
| `xpath` | — | — | 0 |

An em dash is a lane with no cases yet, which is a different claim from a
lane scoring zero. `datatypes` is M3 and effectively complete; `schema` is
M4 and active; `instance` waits on M5; `xpath`, `json` and `ber` wait on
M6/M7, M8 and M11.

Milestones, from GitHub:

| Milestone | Closed | Open | State |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| M0–M2 | 8 | 0 | done |
| M3 — Datatypes | 12 | 1 | complete; one follow-up open |
| M4 — Schema parsing | 71 | 41 | **active** |
| M5 — Instance validation | 0 | 1 | epic #250 filed, **uncarved** |
| M6–M12 | 0 | 0 | not filed |

Queue: 150 open issues — 135 `ready`, 15 `blocked`, 0 `needs-replan`,
2 `epic`.

**Next planning action: carve M5.** Its stated precondition — #180, #181,
#182 and #183 draining — is met; all four are closed. Follow the pattern
that worked for M4 (#79 → #167–#183): model and infoset shape slices
first, then a lane bring-up slice that produces a real `instance` number
early (the #175 analogue), then the validator fan-out.

**Working band** (dependency-ordered top of the `ready` queue, so a
session need not scan 133 issues): *not published in this pass.* This
Status section was written by a process refactor, not by a `/backlog`
run; the next `/backlog` publishes the band with the rest of the
section.

## Milestones

### M0 — Scaffold — done

Repo layout, docs, local specs plus conversion tooling, W3C suite
submodule, per-package `doc.go` contracts, agent personas and commands,
lint gate.

### M1 — Spec infrastructure — done

The hfn → TypeSpec generator emitting `builtin/gen_typespec.go` for all 49
builtins including precisionDecimal, sourced from Appendix E and the
per-type property tables; the conformance ratchet (expectations
load/compare/merge, upward-only, `suite.xml` runner, lane files); and
`xsderr`'s `Rule`/catalog wiring.

### M2 — Foundation leaves — done

`xsderr` (Error/Rule/Loc plus narrowing helpers), `loader` (Resolver with
Dir/FS/HTTP/Map/Chain), `parser/xmltree` (streaming position-tracking
decoder), and the `xsd.QName` expanded-name type that `value.Backend` and
the builtin table key on. Full unit tests; fuzz targets for xmltree.

### M3 — Datatypes vertical slice — complete

All 20 primitives mapped; the facet pipeline, value spaces and canonical
mappings behind the **`datatypes` lane**. Remaining open work is
follow-up, not milestone scope.

### M4 — Schema parsing — active — [epic #79](https://github.com/kud360/goxsd8/issues/79)

Three-phase parser over the composition model — include, import, redefine,
override, chameleon coercion — with UPA, EDC and particle restriction
designed into the model shape from the start, plus the `xsd` component
model and the finalize/resolve phase (`src-resolve`, dependency-ordered
finalization, named-circularity rejection). **`schema` lane.**

The original carve (#167–#183) is landed. Open work is the long tail of
producer widening, finalize validity and composition edge cases; the
GitHub milestone is the list.

### M5 — Instance validation (XML) — [epic #250](https://github.com/kud360/goxsd8/issues/250)

`validate` engine plus `validate/xmlsrc`: greedy deterministic matching,
identity constraints, `xsi:type`/`xsi:nil`, wildcards, default and fixed
values. **`instance` lane.** Filed as an epic and deliberately uncarved
until now; see the Status section for the carve.

### M6 — XPath required subset

CTA restricted subset plus assertion essentials, fail-open with `GAP`
markers, IDC selector and field paths. Dynamic-error direction per
PRINCIPLES 20. Not filed as an epic — speculative epics two milestones out
earn nothing.

One dangling dependency to repoint at the carve: **#56** (a per-assertion
or CTA result must distinguish a genuine PASS from a fail-open
"unevaluated") is blocked on the not-yet-filed evaluator issue. STYLE 9's
fail-open discipline is only honest if a fail-open answer is
distinguishable from a real pass.

### M7 — XPath 2.0 growth

Grammar completion toward full XPath 2.0 plus the F&O function library
(`docs/specs/md/xpath20.md`, `xpath-functions.md`). **`xpath` lane.**

### M8 — JSON instance adapter

`validate/jsonsrc` mapping JSON onto the abstract infoset. **`json` lane**
— curated cases; the W3C suite has no JSON lane.

### M9 — Codegen

Deterministic emission, namer, sealed choice sums, capability-view
interfaces, multiple schemas to multiple output dirs, golden-file tests.
The public `value.Emitter` API freezes here.

### M10 — Codec

Runtime path plus generated fast path; differential tests (identical
values, identical error rule IDs) and `testing.AllocsPerRun` budgets.

### M11 — BER instance adapter

`validate/bersrc`. **`ber` lane** — curated cases.

### M12 — Native backend completion

`builtin/native` mappings and emitter, backendtest green, performance
pass.

## v1.0 — the stability line

1.0 is declared by a human, not by a milestone rollover (expected after
M12). Until then **pre-1.0 mobility** applies: interfaces, package
boundaries and exported names move freely whenever the steward's audit
finds a better placement, and the ratchet and the gate are the only
compatibility promises. After 1.0, exported-surface changes require a
deprecation path and a compatibility argument, and the audit's posture
flips from "move it now" to "guard the surface". Narrower freezes may land
earlier where a milestone says so — `value.Emitter` at M9.

## Non-goals

- Schema mutation and editing APIs.
- XSD 1.0 compatibility quirks — this is an XSD 1.1 processor.
