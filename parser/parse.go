// populated as far as assembly got even when an error is returned.
//
// Every document of the assembly is ·conditional-inclusion pre-processed·
// (§4.2.2) as it is read, before its own directives are followed, so schema(D)
// below is always read over ci(D) — see parser/doc.go's Conditional inclusion
// section.
//
// It implements §4.2.1's schema(D): the components of the root document plus,
// transitively, those of every schema document reached through an <xs:include>
// child (§4.2.3) — including chameleon inclusion, where a document with no
// targetNamespace of its own contributes its components, and its unqualified
// QName references, to the including namespace (§4.2.3 clause 3.2, §F.1) — or
// through an <xs:import> child (§4.2.6), which brings a DIFFERENT namespace's
// components in unchanged: import never coerces, so an imported document's
// components stay in its own target namespace and a cross-namespace reference
// resolves against them at finalize. That <import> element does double duty: it
// is also what LICENSES the referring document to name that namespace at all
// (src-resolve clause 4.2.2, §4.2.6.1), and the license reaches only the
// document the element sits in — see parser/doc.go's Composition section.
// Documents are read once each, keyed by resolved location AND the namespace
// they were reached under AND the override and redefinition applied to them, so
// a diamond or a (spec-legal) cycle of <include>s, or a namespace imported
// repeatedly, contributes its components once and does not trip
// sch-props-correct (§3.17.6.1) clause 2. Reading once skips the re-COMPOSITION
// alone: every <import> element is still judged against src-import clause 3,
// whether or not it was the one that caused D2 to be read.
//
// An <xs:override> child (§4.2.5) is followed too: the document it names is
// composed exactly as an <include>d one — §4.2.5 clause 3.1.2 defines an override
// AS an <include> of the transformed document — after ·override pre-processing·
// substitutes the override's own children for the identically-named source
// declarations of that document and of every document it in turn <include>s or
// <override>s (§F.2, parser/override.go).
//
// An <xs:redefine> child (§4.2.4) is followed too, and is the one directive that
// both adds and subtracts: the document it names is composed as an <include>d
// one, contributing every component it declares EXCEPT those the <redefine>
// explicitly redefines (clause 4.1.2), while the <redefine>'s own children
// contribute the replacements as definitions of THIS document (clause 4.1.1). A
// self-reference inside a redefining declaration resolves to the definition it
// replaces, not to itself (src-expredef, parser/redefine.go). Two things differ
// from <include>: a non-empty <redefine> whose schemaLocation does not resolve is
// an ERROR (src-redefine clause 1) rather than a silent skip, and a redefining
// <simpleType>/<complexType> is PAIRED with the {name}-·absent· original
