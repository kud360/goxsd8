// and charges §3.12.3 src-ta and §3.12.6 ta-props-correct clause 2 over the
// same children. It serves the GLOBAL <element> path (produceElement) and both
// LOCAL ones (produceLocalElement) from one implementation (STYLE T4):
// §3.3.2.1's {type table} row is a COMMON mapping rule and §3.3.2.2
// dcl.elt.global supplements {target namespace} and {scope} alone, so a
// top-level <element> has nothing to map differently.

// ruleSrcTA is Type Alternative Representation OK (Structures §3.12.3,
// id="src-ta"): "each <alternative> element must have one (and only one) of the
// following: a type attribute, or a complexType child element, or a simpleType
// child element". The rule is a single unnumbered sentence, so messages cite no
// clause.
const ruleSrcTA xsderr.Rule = "src-ta"

// ruleTAPropsCorrect is Type Alternative Properties Correct (Structures §3.12.6,
// id="ta-props-correct"), whose clause 2 is "If the {test} is not absent, then
// it satisfies the constraint XPath Valid (§3.13.6.2)" — and xpath-valid clause
// 2 in turn is "X does not produce any static error".
//
// The rule ID is BARE, with no clause suffix: xsderr's catalog is generated from
// the specs and reserves exactly this ID, so a message names its clause inline
// (STYLE E4) instead.

// ctaStaticTypes is the ·in-scope schema definitions· of the static context
// xpath-valid clause 2.2.5 (§3.13.6.2) fixes for the {test} whose static errors
// this file charges: "those components that are present in every schema by
// definition", clause 2.2.5's own three sources (Built-in Attribute
// Declarations §3.2.7, the Built-in Complex Type Definition §3.4.7, and the
// Built-in Simple Type Definitions §3.16.7) — and NOT this schema's own {type
// definitions}, which clause 2.2.5 does not put in scope. No schema is
// finalized at production time to hold those anyway. A CTA cast target is
// always a simple type (§3.12.6 clause 4), so only §3.16.7's Simple Type
// Definitions are ever read here — §3.2.7 and §3.4.7 name no site this
// package resolves against.
//
// It answers from symbols.builtins, the fixed [builtin.Seed] set newSymbols
// indexes once — NOT from the build-once memo symbols.built, which starts as a
// copy of that set and then grows with every named simple type the assembly
// builds. Answering from the memo would make the answer depend on how far the
// parse had reached, and a schema whose own targetNamespace is the XSD namespace
// (unusual, but no rule forbids it) would put its top-level types in scope for
// some <alternative> tests and not others, purely by declaration order — a false
// reject of a legal schema in the over-charging direction.

// typeTableOf maps the <alternative> children of el into the {type table} of
// the element declaration el produces (§3.3.2.1 dcl.elt.common), returning nil
// for the ·absent· property. edID is that declaration's minted identity, the
// {context} every anonymous type an <alternative> owns points back at, and
// declaredType is its own {type definition}, which §3.3.2.1 makes the {default
// type definition}'s {type definition} whenever the final <alternative> carries
// a test.
//
// The mapping, once src-ta has passed over every <alternative>:
//
//   - {alternatives} takes the <alternative> children WITH a test attribute, in
//     document order, each through declare-ta. A TRAILING untested one is not
//     among them — it feeds {default type definition} instead — and an untested
//     one anywhere else maps to nothing at all, which is the mapping as written
//     rather than an omission: {alternatives} is defined over the tested
//     children and {default type definition} over the final child, so a
//     non-final untested <alternative> is named by neither. src-element clause
//     5 (§3.3.3) forbids that document, and this producer does not charge it.
//   - {default type definition} is the final <alternative> through declare-ta
//     when it has no test attribute, and otherwise a Type Alternative
//     SYNTHESIZED with an ·absent· {test}, declaredType as its {type
//     definition}, and an empty {annotations}. §3.3.2.1 makes that synthesized
//     slot "the {type definition} property of the parent Element Declaration",
//     so declaredType is passed through WHOLE — the same component, not a copy,
//     and whichever arm it holds, including the SubstitutionGroupHeadTypeRef a
//     substitutionGroup=-typed element carries.
//
// ta-props-correct clause 2 is charged here, over each {test} as it is built,
// because this is the only site in the module that builds one and alt.Loc() is
// in hand. The constraint it delegates to — xpath-valid clause 2 (§3.13.6.2),
// "does not produce any static error" — is a Schema Component Constraint, so it
// is decided at construction and independent of whether any instance is ever
// ·assessed·; xpath.CTATestStaticError proves the static error and this charges
// it, the engine never minting a rule of its own. An {expression} that engine
// merely cannot EVALUATE is no fault at all and passes straight through, on the
// terms xpath/cta.go argues (PRINCIPLES 20). The type knowledge it is asked
// against is ctaStaticTypes, clause 2.2.5's set and not this schema's.
//
// {annotations} is the empty sequence on every Type Alternative built here,
// matching every other component this producer emits: no <annotation> is mapped
// anywhere in this package yet.

// the same entry point an inline <simpleType> child of an <element> or
// <attribute> takes, and its {context} (§3.16.1 std-context) is unmodeled here as
// it is everywhere else in this producer (#206).
