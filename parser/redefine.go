// This file implements <xs:redefine> (§4.2.4, src-redefine and src-expredef):
// including a schema document while REPLACING some of its top-level
// simpleType/complexType/group/attributeGroup definitions with new ones written
// inline, each of which may build on the definition it replaces.
//
// §4.2.4 marks the whole mechanism ·deprecated· — "may be removed from future
// versions of this specification. Schema authors are encouraged to avoid its use
// in cases where interoperability or compatibility with later versions of this
// specification are important" — and §4.2.5 says why: "existing XSD processors
// have implemented conflicting and non-interoperable interpretations of
// <redefine>". It is implemented here because §4.2.4 is still normative, not
// because it is recommended; nothing in this file is a behaviour change to
// <xs:override>, which exists to replace it.
//
// # The shape of the mechanism
//
// A <redefine> is an <include> plus a rewrite, so it enters at the DISCOVER
// phase alongside <include>/<import>/<override> and the rewrite is carried as
// DATA — a redefineSet threaded through discovery beside the effective target
// namespace and the ·override pre-processing· — exactly as parser/override.go
// carries §F.2. No tree is rewritten and no node is synthesized.
//
// Two documents meet over one redefineSet, and they read it from opposite sides:
//
//	D1, the REDEFINING document, holds the <redefine> element. Its producer
//	     maps the <redefine>'s children as top-level definitions of its own
//	     (src-expredef clause 1.2 / clause 2, §4.2.4 clause 4.1.1).
//	D2, the REDEFINED document, is the one the schemaLocation names. Its
//	     producer contributes every component it declares EXCEPT those the set
//	     names (§4.2.4 clause 4.1.2, "with the exception of those explicitly
//	     redefined"), and records each excepted declaration as the ORIGINAL a
//	     self-reference in D1 resolves to.
//
// # Self-reference: the two-component pairing (src-expredef)
//
// A redefining <simpleType>/<complexType> corresponds to TWO components: a
// hidden one with {name} ·absent· that is the ORIGINAL (clause 1.1), and the
// visible redefining one whose {base type definition} is that hidden original
// (clause 1.2). "This pairing ensures the coherence constraints on type
// definitions are respected, while at the same time achieving the desired
// effect, namely that references to names of redefined components in both the
// <redefine>ing and <redefine>d schema documents ·resolve· to the redefined
// component". A redefining <group>/<attributeGroup> corresponds to a SINGLE
// component, but "if and when a self-reference based on a ref [attribute] …
// is ·resolved·, a component which corresponds to the top-level definition item
// of that name and the appropriate kind in S2 is used" (clause 2).
//
// Getting that wrong produces a FALSE CIRCULARITY — a type or group appearing to
// derive from or contain itself — so the FOUR resolution sites that can meet a
// self-reference each consult the set first: resolveBase (a simple type's base=)
// and redefinedComplexBase (a complex type's, both produce.go),
// produceGroupRefParticle (a <group ref>) and collectReferencedGroup (an
// <attributeGroup ref>, both produce_complex.go).
//
// # The complex-type pairing (#505)
//
// A redefining <complexType> is a NAMED component that OWNS its
// {name}-·absent· base outright, which xsd.ComplexType's {base type definition}
// slot expresses as the InlineTypeDefinition arm of a TypeDefinitionOrRef and
// xsd.NewComplexTypeOwningBase is the only entry point for. The producer mints
// ONE xsd.ComponentID per redefinition (namedComplexTypeIdentity, produce.go),
// builds clause 1.1's original from the REDEFINED document's own declaration and
// under that document's producer, and threads the identity into both halves so
// the original's {context} points back at the redefining component; the
// constructor checks the two agree.
//
// The pairing is built at buildComplexType, not here, because the redefining
// declaration is reachable by NAME as well: prescanRedefine registers it under
// its own expanded name, so a reference from either document arrives through
// resolveBaseType. One decision point means one component per name, which is
// what makes src-expredef's note ("references … in both the <redefine>ing and
// <redefine>d schema documents ·resolve· to the redefined component") hold.
//
// src-redefine clause 5 is charged BEFORE the pairing is attempted, so a
// redefining complex type that does not derive from itself is rejected for that
// rule rather than for a missing original.
//
// # The chain (#585)
//
// D2 may itself <redefine> a D3 for the SAME (kind, name). Clause 4.1.1 makes
// D2's redefining child a top-level definition of D2, so it is what D1's clause
// 1.1 pairs with — and clause 4.1.2, applied at D2's level, keeps D3's own
// declaration out of D2's component set entirely, so wiring D1 straight to D3
// would drop D2's redefinition from the hierarchy D1 sees. The pairing therefore
// nests: D1's hidden original IS D2's redefining declaration, built anonymously,
// owning D3's hidden original in turn. Each level mints its own identity for the
// edge below it, so the anonymous levels stay distinct components
// (redefineOriginalComplexType, produce_complex.go).
//
// Composing it needs no new resolution site. Both type-side sites already ask the
// producer of the document the declaration came from — resolveBase recursing
// through src.owner, and redefinedComplexBase through src.owner.produceComplexType
// — so a declaration that is itself redefining meets its OWN set there. What was
// missing was the recording: prescanRedefine now records a chained redefinition as
// the outer set's original, which chainedOriginal gates.

// redefineEntry is one non-<annotation> child of a <redefine> element paired
// with the key it redefines on. Entries are kept as a SLICE in document order,
// never as a bare map, because that order is the order the redefining components
// enter the builder and so reaches the user through the component set and
// through duplicate reports (STYLE D2).
