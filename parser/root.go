// Root is one root location of the document set [ParseSet] assembles: a schema
// document the caller names outright ([RootAt]) or a schema location hint, a
// location paired with the namespace it is expected to declare ([HintAt]). It
// is a closed set (STYLE T2's sealed-sum exception), so the two constructors
// are the only way to build one.
//
// Which composition a root gets is derived from which constructor built it,
// never from a flag: a RootAt root is read exactly as [ParseReport] reads its
// root, in its own target namespace, and a HintAt root is followed exactly as an
// <xs:import> of that namespace is (§4.2.6.2), checked against src-import clause
// 3.
//
// Root values are comparable, and [AssemblyReport.UnfollowedRoots] hands back
// the caller's own values, so a caller identifies a root it passed by comparing
// it with ==, or names it by Location.
