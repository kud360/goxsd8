// Command casejoin turns suite fixture PATHS into the conformance case IDs
// conformance/testdata/expectations/<lane>.txt is keyed by, and joins them
// against a lane's committed file.
//
// A ratchet PREDICTION starts from a corpus census — `go tool suiteindex`
// reports which fixtures carry a construct — and CLAUDE.md then prescribes
// joining that census through a lane's expectation file. The two sides are
// keyed differently: a census names a DOCUMENT by path, and an expectation
// file names a CASE by `<testSet>/<testGroup>/<kind>/<test-name>`, an ID
// assembled from catalog attribute values that need bear no relation to the
// href beside them. Nothing bridged them, so two grounding rounds running
// predicted `not derived` and the lane then moved anyway (#1494, #1585). This
// is the bridge, and it is a tool because the walk is deterministic and
// error-prone by hand (PRINCIPLES 27).
//
// # The two questions, which are different
//
// ENUMERATE — `casejoin ids` — answers which catalog entries name a path. The
// relation is one-to-many in that direction: `saxonData/Missing/missing001.v1.xml`
// is named by an instanceTest in four different test groups, so it yields four
// case IDs. Every entry the catalog declares is reported, WITHHELD ones
// included: an entry the suite's applicability metadata scopes away from this
// processor is a real catalog entry that merely carries no line in any lane.
// Both modes COUNT distinct entries — an entry naming two of the given paths
// is one entry to either — so the two headers are arithmetic over one input
// and a reader may compare them.
//
// JOIN — `casejoin join <lane>` — answers how many BANKED cases of one lane
// name those paths and could still flip. A withheld entry carries no line and
// is not counted (#1412); neither is an entry no lane selects, nor one already
// banked `pass`, which cannot flip upward. The four Missing entries above
// therefore join to ZERO, which is the right answer to a different question
// from the four the enumeration reports.
//
// # Which document edges are reported
//
// All of them. A case names its documents through two lists, and a path
// matching either one is reported: the document(s) UNDER TEST — a
// schemaTest's ordered <schemaDocument> list, or an instanceTest's one
// <instanceDocument> — and, for an instance case, the schema documents it is
// ASSESSED AGAINST, which are its test group's sibling schemaTest's list
// (conformance.CatalogEntry). Reporting only the first would silently answer
// zero for every schema-side census, whose fixtures are named by the instance
// cases assessed against them. Each reported entry says which edge matched.
//
// # What the count is, and is not
//
// A candidate case count is a BOUND FROM ABOVE on the cases a change to the
// censused construct could flip — never a prediction of flips, and never a
// lane movement. The report says so where the figure is, and names the three
// directions it is wrong in.
