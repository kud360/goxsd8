// Command suiteindex takes a census of the W3C xsdtests corpus: which
// fixtures carry a given XML construct, across every file in the tree and in
// every encoding the corpus ships.
//
// A grounding round predicting ratchet movement needs the set of fixtures
// exercising a construct. Deriving that set by grep failed three landings
// running, each by a different mechanism, and the fix installed for each
// reached only that one: a UTF-16LE fixture read as interleaved NULs by a
// UTF-8 grep, a fixture outside the single directory the previous finding
// had named, and a fixture found by matching one clause's SHAPE instead of
// the construct it carries (#1239). PRINCIPLES 27 turns that shape of
// repeated, deterministic work into a tool.
//
// # What it matches
//
// A query names a construct, never a spelling of one. Element names match on
// the resolved (namespace URI, local name) pair, so `<xsd:element>`,
// `<xs:element>` and a bare `<element>` under
// `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"` are one construct and all three
// answer one query. Matching prefix text is the defect this tool retires:
// the corpus writes all three spellings, sometimes within one directory.
//
// Attribute names match by local name in no namespace, which is what an
// unprefixed attribute resolves to — XSD's own vocabulary attributes
// (targetNamespace, form, ref) are always written unprefixed. A namespace
// declaration (xmlns, xmlns:p) is not an attribute and never matches
// ([xmltree.StartElement.Attributes]).
//
// A local name may be written `*`, which stands for every local name in its
// namespace: `*` is every element in the XML Schema namespace and `@*` is
// every attribute in no namespace. The wildcard is what makes a census
// UNANCHORED — an axis over every element, or over every attribute name,
// rather than a lookup of one construct — and it needs no escape, since `*`
// is not an NCName and no document can spell a name that collides with it.
//
// A NAMESPACE may be written `{*}`, which stands for every namespace at once,
// the no-namespace one included: `{*}root` is every `root` element in the
// corpus whatever namespace it sits in, and `{*}*` is every element there is.
// The element position needs it because a braceless element name means the
// XML Schema namespace — right for a schema document, wrong for an INSTANCE
// one, whose elements sit in whatever namespace its test targets — so an
// instance-side census was inexpressible and answered `0 occurrence(s)`
// rather than saying so (#1495). It cannot be confused with `{}local`, which
// is the one namespace that has no name, and it costs no census that worked
// before: `{*}local` parsed as the namespace literally named `*`, which
// nothing in this corpus declares.
//
// Attribute names are joined by `,` (an element must carry EVERY one to count
// as an occurrence) or by `|` (ANY one of them is enough). One query uses one
// join, never both, and `@*` stands alone: it already names the whole
// attribute axis. A query that names its attributes prints the values it
// matched, in query order.
//
// ELEMENT names take the `|` join only, which is how a FEATURE spelled by
// more than one element is censused in one query:
// `openContent|defaultOpenContent` is the `{open content}` population, whose
// halves counted apart under-predicted a landing's ratchet movement (#1554).
// The `,` join is refused in that position rather than matching nothing — no
// element carries two names at once — and a query naming more than one of
// them always prints the element each hit was, since the query no longer
// fixes it.
//
// # Containment
//
// A query may require its occurrences to lie INSIDE another matching element,
// at any depth, by writing that element's pattern ahead of `//`:
// `*@maxOccurs//*@maxOccurs` is every element carrying `maxOccurs` that
// stands inside another one carrying it. A population defined by nesting had
// no spelling at all before, so two grounding rounds running answered
// `not derived` and measured their landing by hand instead (#1585). Both
// sides of `//` are whole patterns — element alternatives, an attribute list
// and its join each — and each side is read on its own, so `A//B` finds a B
// under an A and never a B under a B.
//
// An element is not its own ancestor: a start tag answering both patterns
// qualifies nothing but its own descendants, which is the entire difference
// between `A//A` and `A`. A hit records the INNERMOST enclosing element that
// matched, since that is the one a reader checks the nest against first.
//
// One query names one ancestor. A second `//` is refused rather than read as
// a chain: the ancestor side is a pattern and takes no ancestor of its own, so
// a chain is unrepresentable rather than silently half-applied.
//
// Containment is the DOCUMENT's own nesting. This census never resolves an
// `<element ref>` or a `<group ref>`, so a containment figure answers for a
// lexical population and not for a population of resolved components; the
// report says so in its own output, in both directions it can be wrong
// ([printCaveat]).
//
// # Encoding
//
// Encoding is this tool's problem, not the caller's. Every fixture is read
// through [xmltree.Reader], which detects a byte-order mark and transcodes
// UTF-16 to UTF-8 before any token reaches the matcher (XML 1.0 §4.3.3).
// The suite's UTF-16 fixtures all carry a mark, so xmltree's markless-UTF-16
// gap (#361) does not reach this corpus.
//
// # What it reports
//
// A query that names the attributes it looks for reports its MATCHES, sorted
// by path with document order preserved within each file. A query that
// wildcards them (`@*`) reports the attribute-NAME AXIS instead: the
// (element, attribute) pairs, then the fixtures carrying each pair. Both end
// with every file the census could not read all the way through as XML: the
// ones that broke off partway, and the ones that held no element at all.
//
// The axis is grouped because ungrouped it is not a report anyone reads:
// `*@*` over the suite is 172,565 attribute occurrences, which one line each
// renders unreadable, and 185 pairs, which a table renders in a screenful
// (#1391). Its first section is that table — pair, occurrence count, fixture
// count, in name order — and its second lists each pair's fixtures in path
// order, deduplicated, so a pair's own fixtures are read off the section
// rather than by re-querying it.
//
// A match line carries its position, then the matched element's name where
// the query does not already fix it — a wildcard local part, the `{*}`
// namespace axis, or more than one element alternative — and never where it
// does, then `parent=` naming the element it is a direct child of — `(none)`
// for a document element — then `children=[…]` listing the elements directly
// under it, then the matched attributes' values. The parent is what
// separates a local occurrence from a top-level one, which no query over an
// element's OWN attributes can express (#1282). It is the parent the
// document actually spells, never one corrected against the grammar: an
// `xs:element` under `xs:redefine` is reported there, wrong though that
// document is, and its children are reported the same way.
//
// A containment query prints its caveat ahead of the body, and each match
// line carries an `ancestor=` field naming the innermost enclosing element
// that matched the ancestor pattern. That is not the `parent=` field: a
// qualifying ancestor stands any number of levels up, and the two name
// different elements as soon as the nest is deeper than one. Neither the
// caveat nor the field appears for a query without an ancestor pattern, whose
// report is the same bytes it always was.
//
// An element name the report prints is spelled so that it re-enters as a
// query naming that same element, which is why a parent or child in NO
// namespace prints as `{}name` rather than bare: bare is the XML Schema
// namespace on the way back in (#1297).
//
// The child list is in document order and keeps repeats, because a
// content-model census turns on multiplicity: "no child outside
// `annotation | simpleType | complexType`" survives deduplication and "nor a
// second `simpleType` beside a first" does not (#1304). `children=[]` is an
// occurrence with no element child at all. A list whose last entry is
// `(unclosed)` is one whose read broke off before the match's own end tag, so
// the names ahead of the marker are a prefix rather than the whole list — a
// fact about that MATCH and not about its file, since a fixture can fault at
// its tail with every match in it already closed and every child list
// complete.
//
// `-paths` prints the matched fixtures ALONE on stdout, one path per line and
// nothing else, for a tool downstream: `go tool casejoin` turns that list into
// the conformance case IDs a lane's expectation file is keyed by, which is the
// join CLAUDE.md prescribes for a ratchet prediction (#1642). The header, its
// counts and any caveat go to stderr in that mode, so a pipeline still leaves
// them in front of the human; the per-file listings below are left to a plain
// run of the same query.
//
// The corpus ships deliberately malformed fixtures, so a parse fault is
// content rather than a failure: the matches found ahead of it are kept and
// the file is listed, because a construct BEHIND the fault is invisible here
// and the reader is the one who gets to judge that. Both groups are listed in
// full and nothing is elided — most of the second group is the suite's
// images, prose and stylesheets, but a census that counts what it could not
// read instead of naming it under-reports exactly as the greps did.
