// Command wipsurvey classifies every wip/issue-<N> branch on the origin
// remote as LIVE, CLAIMED, EXPIRED, RETIRED, or UNKNOWN, so a /develop
// session does not have to re-derive by hand which branches are contended
// and which are dead. Issue #399 measured seven consecutive develop
// passes each re-deriving the same three unchanged facts about the same
// dead branches; PRINCIPLES 27 turns exactly that shape of repetitive,
// deterministic work into a tool. Every other head the remote carries is
// reported too, unclassified: a survey that silently skips a namespace
// cannot be told from one that looked and found it empty.
//
// Classification needs two sources that neither shows on its own:
//   - the branch namespace, for how recently a branch's tip was pushed
//     (WORKFLOW.md's 2-hour claim TTL, PRINCIPLES 28); and
//   - the GitHub issue thread, for whether the branch's owner issue has
//     since closed or been retired with needs-replan — retirement is
//     recorded on the issue, never in the branch namespace, so a survey
//     built from git alone cannot see it.
//
// The branch set itself must come from the remote, not from local
// remote-tracking refs. `git for-each-ref refs/remotes/origin/wip/*`
// returns every branch this checkout has EVER seen, including ones GitHub
// auto-deleted at merge that nobody has since `git fetch --prune`d away —
// reporting those as LIVE or EXPIRED invents in-flight work out of stale
// local state, exactly backwards for a tool whose purpose is telling a
// session what still exists. `git ls-remote --heads origin` asks the
// remote directly instead, matching the WIP discovery index WORKFLOW.md
// and PRINCIPLES 28 both name authoritative.
//
// That one round trip asks for every head, not for a pattern, because
// WORKFLOW.md's branch scheme names TWO namespaces — wip/* and parked/* —
// and a report covering one of them cannot say which one it covered. Five
// PLAN.md stamps reported a parked/* count taken from a refspec that
// never carried parked/*, and the count was right every time, which is
// the hazard rather than the reprieve (#1627). So wip/issue-<N> refs are
// the classified rows, and two trailing sections report the rest: the
// parked/* branches WORKFLOW.md keeps for human triage, and every head
// outside both namespaces. Each section prints a "none" line when its
// namespace is empty, so a zero this tool measured never reads like a
// namespace nobody looked at.
//
// A head outside both namespaces holds no lease and is cleanup a human
// does, with one state worth counting: a ref AHEAD of main carries
// commits main does not have. A merged session branch whose auto-delete
// did not fire and a session branch stranding the only copy of a landing
// look identical by name, and one of the latter stood behind an unmerged
// PR for a day with a /backlog pass's whole log entry on it, in a
// namespace no survey read (#1627). Each such row prints `git rev-list
// --left-right --count <main>...<ref>`'s pair and says in words when
// ahead is nonzero. A checkout that never fetched the ref's tip cannot
// count either side, and that row prints the counts as undecided rather
// than as a zero nothing measured — the posture the tip age already
// takes.
//
// A maintenance command's short-lived branch is such a head between its
// push and its squash-merge, so it prints in that section, ahead>0, while
// it is landing. Nothing is owed on it and nothing distinguishes it there
// from a branch whose merge never happened, which is the same reading a
// human does on every row of the section.
//
// ls-remote reports only a SHA per branch, not a date, so each tip's
// commit time still comes from the local object store (`git log -1
// --format=%cI <sha>`). When that SHA has never been fetched into this
// checkout, the tool does not guess an age for it: a guessed age could
// read as EXPIRED (resumable), the dangerous direction for a lease it has
// no data behind. It reports the branch UNKNOWN instead and says to
// fetch.
//
// A tip age is only evidence about the branch that authored it. A
// wip/issue-<N> branch pushed as a bare claim, with no commits yet, points
// at whatever main pointed at when the session started, so its tip age
// measures the PREVIOUS LANDING and not the claim: a claim made minutes
// ago reports as hours old, EXPIRED, and therefore resumable, and the
// session that acts on it races a live holder (#722). Such a branch is an
// ancestor of main, which `git merge-base --is-ancestor` decides against
// the main SHA the same ls-remote round trip already fetched. Those
// branches are reported CLAIMED: the branch name establishes a claim,
// nothing establishes its age, so the branch is off-limits for retirement
// and is not resumable on age evidence alone.
//
// What dates such a claim is the issue thread's own clock, and only part
// of it: WORKFLOW.md's lease invariant dates an empty claim from the
// newest comment whose body opens with a heartbeat marker (RESUME: or
// TAKEOVER:), because those are the comments that assert a session is
// still holding the branch. A grounding, a verdict, a mason's account or
// a planning note records work already done and dates nothing — dating a
// lease from one locks the issue for a further TTL after its session died
// (#981). Supply each issue's comments in the input and this tool applies
// that rule, reporting the branch LIVE or EXPIRED with the heartbeat's
// age. Omit them — or find a thread with no heartbeat ever posted on it,
// which is how every claim starts life — and the branch stays CLAIMED for
// a reader to settle by hand. Only an aged heartbeat makes an empty claim
// EXPIRED; an absent one is not a lapsed one.
//
// A claim taken over again and again that still adds nothing to main is
// EXPIRED every cycle, and EXPIRED is the verdict /develop prefers to
// pick, so such a branch is routed back to the next session forever.
// What "adds nothing" means is the net `origin/main...tip` diff, not the
// commit count: WORKFLOW.md's lease invariant has each takeover push a
// heartbeat commit, so a branch that has been taken over even once has
// commits of its own and an empty diff, and a rule keyed on the commit
// count would fire only where that invariant was breached. From
// takeoverRemedyThreshold TAKEOVER: comments on, the EXPIRED reason of a
// branch whose diff is empty names the remedy — relabel the issue
// needs-replan — inline, the way the UNKNOWN reason names `git fetch
// origin`. Counting those cycles by eye across sessions is the work
// PRINCIPLES 27 turns into a tool (#1437). That count is zero for an
// input that carried no comments, so such a row says so rather than
// reading as a thread with no takeovers on it (#1493).
//
// Both the ancestry test and the diff test need main's commit object in
// this checkout, while the SHA they test against comes live from
// ls-remote, so a checkout that last fetched before the most recent
// landing cannot decide either. A row whose ancestry is undecided falls
// back to its tip age and its reason says so, which is what makes a LIVE
// or EXPIRED there provisional rather than settled (#806); a row whose
// diff is undecided simply names no remedy.
//
// Usage:
//
//	git fetch origin
//	gh issue list --state all --json number,state,labels,comments | go tool wipsurvey
//	gh issue list --state all --json number,state,labels | go tool wipsurvey  # empty claims stay CLAIMED
//	go tool wipsurvey < /dev/null   # issue data omitted: lease-only report
//
// Every fed row must carry `state`: an absent one would read as OPEN, and a
// branch whose issue is closed could never report RETIRED. A fed list with
// any row lacking it is discarded whole — the report still prints, every
// branch judged lease-only — and the run exits 2 naming the first such issue
// (#1604).
//
// Exit status is 0 for a normal report (whatever the branches' verdicts
// turn out to be) and 2 for an operational error: git is not on PATH, the
// remote is unreachable, stdin carries malformed JSON, or a fed row carries
// no `state`.

//
// The lease age is the tip's age for a branch with commits of its own and
// the newest heartbeat comment's age for one with none. It is nil where
// nothing in this input dates the lease: an unfetched tip, an empty claim
// no heartbeat dates, or a retired branch with no commits of its own —
// retirement does not turn a landing's tip into the branch's own lease
// (#809). It is what the report's LEASE AGE column prints, which renders
// the nil cases as "main's" or "unknown" rather than as a duration.
//
// tip is nil when the branch's SHA has never been fetched into this
// checkout's object store; classify then reports unknown rather than
// guessing an age, because a guessed age could read as expired
// (resumable) — the dangerous direction for a lease with no data behind
// it. issue is nil when no issue data was supplied (stdin was empty), when
// the fed list was discarded for a row missing `state` ([missingState]), or
// when the branch's issue number was not present in it; the reason then notes
// the verdict is lease-only.
//
// The order of the four questions is itself the contract:
//
//   - Retirement first: a closed or needs-replan issue retires its branch
//     outright, with or without a fetched tip and with or without commits
//     of its own, per WORKFLOW.md's "abandoned attempts are retired in
//     place ... never resumed." The verdict ignores the ancestry, but the
//     lease age reads it: a retired branch that never committed has no
//     more age of its own than a live one does.
//   - Then an unfetched tip, which is unknown.
//   - Then anc == ancestryNoCommits, which classifyEmptyClaim dates from
//     the issue thread: the tip belongs to a landing, not to this branch,
//     so no age question may be asked of it at all.
//   - Only then the tip age, against the claim TTL. ancestryUnresolved
//     lands here too — the age is the best evidence left, and it is the
//     evidence this tool reported before it could ask about ancestry — but
//     its reason says the ancestry was undecided, so the verdict reads as
//     provisional rather than settled (#806).
//
// Both paths that return EXPIRED end their reason with remedyClause,
// which is where #1437's repeated-takeover remedy is named. The tip-age
// path is the one a branch of heartbeat commits and merge-forwards takes,
// so leaving the clause off it would leave the rule silent on exactly the
// branches WORKFLOW.md's lease invariant produces.
//
// The tip-age EXPIRED reason also carries missingCommentsClause, which
// names the input remedyClause is reading a zero from when the input
// carried no comments (#1493). classifyEmptyClaim needs no such clause:
// it answers CLAIMED, naming the same missing input, before it can reach
