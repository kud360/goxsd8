// This file is §3.3.4.1's ·selected type definition· — the half of the
// ·governing type definition· that a {type table} decides — and nothing else.
// The ·overriding· xsi:type read that sits above it stays in assess.go, where
// key-governing-type-elem's own clause order lives.

// ruleKeyCTATASelect is ·successfully selects· (§3.12.4, key-cta-ta-select),
// the check conditionallySelected reaches for each Type Alternative and does
// not perform when the alternative's {test} cannot be compiled. It is a
// [Definition:] anchor and NOT a Validation Rule, because §3.12.4 defines
// conditional type assignment through definitions and gives it no cvc-* rule of
// its own — so this is the only ID the spec text offers for the check, and an
// invented cvc-cta* one would name nothing (#56).
//
// It is a Rule only ever carried by an [Unevaluated], never by an
// [xsderr.Error]: a failed key-cta-ta-select charges no element. The
// alternative simply does not ·successfully select·, and key-cta-select's scan
// moves to the next one or to the {default type definition} — which is why the
// package charges nothing under this ID and must not start.

// resolvedSelection has already charged and [walk.declaredGovernance] answers
// with ·lax assessment·.
//
// The rule has exactly two cases and they are taken in its order: clause 1,

//
// A [xsd.SubstitutionGroupHeadTypeRef] whose head names no declaration, which
// Finalize accepts (xsd's resolveTypeDefinitionSlot), is an ·absent· value
// where a component is mandated (§5.3 Missing Sub-components), so S is ·absent·
// and §5.3 makes validating e "as if clause 1 of Element Locally Valid
// (Element) had failed", falling back to ·lax assessment·. That is cvc-elt
// clause 1 CHARGED at e's own location, and a nil S returned with ok true for
// [walk.declaredGovernance] to assess e laxly. The parser never builds this
// shape: it gives the member of an unresolvable substitutionGroup head

// conditionallySelected is the type a Type Table ·conditionally selects· for e

// {default type definition}'s {type definition} is the answer. Every {test}
// reads e's own [[attributes]] and inherited, e's [inherited attributes]
// (ctaAttributes).
//
// The scan is LAZY in both directions the rule quantifies in. It compiles and
// evaluates one alternative at a time, because "if any Type Alternative
// ·successfully selects· a type definition, none of the following Type
// Alternatives are tried" — so an alternative this engine cannot evaluate,
// sitting BEHIND one whose test is true, never costs e its type.
//
// An alternative this engine cannot evaluate, sitting BEFORE any that
// succeeds, withholds the whole element's ·governing type definition· and
// stops the scan. It does NOT fall through to the next alternative or to the
// {default type definition}: the undecided test might have been true, so
// continuing would select a type the rule may not have selected, and
// assessing an element against the wrong type manufactures a false reject in
// both directions (the charge governingType's own doc rules out). Withholding
// can only cost a rejection.
//
// That withhold is RECORDED, as one [Unevaluated] under ruleKeyCTATASelect at
// the element's own location: nothing downstream charges the element, so
// without the record an element whose ·governing type definition· was withheld
// is byte-identical at the [Result] API to one that passed every rule (#56).
// A selected {type definition} that resolves to nothing is resolvedSelection's:
// an ·absent· head charged there under cvc-elt clause 1, a nil slot withheld
// and recorded there under cvc-elt.
//
// A DYNAMIC OR TYPE ERROR INSIDE AN EVALUABLE {test} IS NOT RECORDED, because
// it is not a withhold: key-cta-ta-select clause 2 says such a {test} "is
// treated as if it had evaluated (without error) to false", so the alternative
// has been tried and did not select, and the scan continues to the next one or
// to the {default type definition} with a real type in hand. [xpath.CTATest]
// evaluation therefore reports a bool and no error at all, and the two
// outcomes stay apart at the type level rather than by a check here.
//
// w.schema is the xsd.TypeResolver both halves of the engine take, and it is
// passed rather than stored on either side: the compile reads the {type
// definitions} to classify the datatype a {test} casts to, and the evaluation
// reads them again to walk that type's {base type definition} chain.
//
// e-props-correct clause 6, which xsd.NewTypeTable enforces at construction,
// makes every {alternatives} member's {test} present, so the presence flag
// carries nothing here; a table that reached this package without it declines
// anyway, because a zero XPath Expression record has an empty {expression} and
// no {expression} is a Test production.
