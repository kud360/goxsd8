// ruleCvcIdentityConstraint is Identity-constraint Satisfied (Structures
// §3.11.4, cvc-identity-constraint). The clause charged goes in the message on
// ruleCvcElt's terms: the catalog carries the bare name, so
// "cvc-identity-constraint.4.2.1" is not a valid [xsderr.Rule].
const ruleCvcIdentityConstraint xsderr.Rule = "cvc-identity-constraint"

// This file decides cvc-identity-constraint (§3.11.4) for every element the
// walk assesses, and builds the [identity-constraint table] of §3.11.5 for
// every element it visits. The path evaluation the two rest on is the icpath
// package's.
//
// The whole design follows from one sentence of §3.11.5: an element's node
// tables are "assembled strictly recursively from the node tables of
// descendants". Node tables therefore propagate UPWARD and only upward
// (PRINCIPLES 15) — which is what makes clause 4.3's Note true, that "only
// element information items within the sub-tree rooted at the element
// information item being ·validated· can be referenced successfully", and what
// makes a keyref on E blind to a key sourced in a SIBLING's subtree.
//
// The walk is the recursion §3.11.5 asks for, so the state rides it rather than
// being rebuilt over a tree the engine never holds ([Children] is a pull
// cursor):
//
//   - ENTERING an element, [walk.identityCheck] advances every live selector
//     and field path one level ([icpath.Live.Advance]), opens a frame for each
//     identity constraint its own ·governing element declaration· declares, and
//     registers the element as a ·target node· or as a field node wherever a
//     path completed.
//   - LEAVING it, [walk.identityExit] fills the field slots this element's own
//     ·initial value· supplies, settles clauses 3 and 4 for the frames rooted
//     here, merges its children's node tables with its own qualified entries
//     under §3.11.5's conflict resolution, settles clause 4.3 against the
//     result, and hands the merged table to its parent.
//
// Clause 2 — "each node in the ·target node set· is either the context node or
// an element node among its descendants" — is satisfied by construction and
// never charged: a selector cursor is seeded at the element the constraint is
// declared on and only ever advances DOWNWARD into that element's [[children]],
// so no path this file evaluates can reach a node outside the subtree.
//
// ·Skipped· nodes need no filtering either (clause 1's "after omitting all
// element nodes corresponding to element information items that are
// ·skipped·"): [walk.child] returns before [walk.element] for a child
// ·attributed to· a skip wildcard or to an {open content} with a skip
// {wildcard} ([walk.childGoverning]), so no icCheck is ever built for it or for
// anything beneath it, and its subtree contributes no target, no field value
// and no node-table entry.

// icCheck is the identity-constraint state of ONE element information item,
// built by [walk.identityCheck] as the walk enters it and settled by
// [walk.identityExit] as the walk leaves. It is the analogue of contentCheck
// for §3.11.4, and like it holds nothing that outlives its element — except
// table, which is the one thing §3.11.5 has travel upward.
//
// sels and flds are the cursors live AT this element, ready to advance into its
// [[children]]; frames are the constraints declared on this element, whose
// targets and node table close here. pending records the field slots this
// element's OWN ·initial value· fills, which is why gather exists: an element's
// character content is complete only once its [[children]] are exhausted, so a
// field node's value is recorded on the way out and not on the way in.
//
// defaulted and hasDefault are the {value constraint} cvc-elt clause 5.1
// substituted for that ·initial value·, written by substitute once the
// [[children]] are exhausted and read by assessed. They are not derivable from
// initial: a {lexical form} of "" substitutes the same empty string an element
// with no character [[children]] already has, and the two are different answers.
