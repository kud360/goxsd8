// This file is §3.3.5.6's [inherited attributes] (e-inherited_attributes) and
// nothing else. Its one reader is the XDM instance a Type Alternative's {test}
// evaluates against, §3.12.4 key-cta-ta-select clause 1.1.3 (ctaAttributes,
// cta.go).

// inheritedAttribute is one member of an element's [inherited attributes]: the
// ·expanded name· and [[normalized value]] of an attribute information item some
// ancestor carries, which is all clause 1.1.3's copy reads. The item's [[owner
// element]] is not kept: e-inherited_attributes clause 2 is the only rule that
// reads it, and [walk.handedDown] settles that clause by the order it composes
// in, while clause 1.1.3 gives the copy E as its owner.

// handedDown is the [inherited attributes] of every element [[child]] of e
// (§3.3.5.6, e-inherited_attributes), where g is e's governance and inherited is
// e's OWN [inherited attributes]: first e's own attributes that are ·potentially
// inherited· (key-p-inherited), then each member of inherited whose ·expanded
// name· none of those has.
//
// key-p-inherited quantifies over "one of E's ancestors" at any depth, and
// e-inherited_attributes clause 2 keeps, of two same-named candidates, the one
// whose [[owner element]] is the descendant of the other's. Computed top-down,
// that reduces to this one-level composition: e's own candidates are the
// nearest any child has, so nothing shadows them, and every candidate from
// further up already had its shadowing by e's ancestors settled when inherited
// was computed for e. The one new edge is e's own candidates over inherited — and
// it is drawn by e's POTENTIALLY INHERITED attributes alone, so an attribute of
// e that is not inheritable shadows nothing above it.
//
// key-p-inherited clause 2, the same [validation context], holds for every pair
// this is asked of: one [Validator.Assess] call has one ·validation root·, which
// is the [validation context] of every item below it, and the root is handed
// nil. Validating two subtrees of one infoset as separate roots in one call
// would make the clause load-bearing, and nothing here could tell them apart.
//
// The property exists only for a child that is not attributed to a skip
// Wildcard, of a parent that is not ·skipped·. Nothing here tests either,
// because neither can arise: [walk.child] stops before [walk.element] for such a
// child, and a ·skipped· parent is never walked at all.
//
// An e whose ·governing type definition· this package could not determine
// hands down a set read off the top-level declarations alone, which a use of
// its real type might contradict. No reader sees it: such an e attributes its
// [[children]] to nothing, so no element below it is typed and no {type table}
// is consulted ([walk.childGoverning]).
