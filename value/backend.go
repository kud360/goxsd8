// Context supplies the dynamic information a lexical mapping needs beyond the
// literal itself. QName and NOTATION mapping is context-dependent: it resolves
// a prefix against the in-scope namespace bindings at the point of the literal
// (Datatypes §3.3.18/§3.3.19, xmlschema11-2.md — prose-only, with no Appendix E
// hfn), which is why [Mapping.Parse] receives one (PRINCIPLES 19).
type Context interface {
	// LookupNamespace resolves prefix to its bound namespace name in scope;
	// ok is false when the prefix has no binding. The empty prefix is the
	// default namespace.
	LookupNamespace(prefix string) (namespace string, ok bool)
}

// Mapping is a type's lexical↔value mapping.
//
// Parse turns a normalized lexical form into a [Value], using ctx for the
// context-dependent types. A lexical that the wider-space facet checks accept
// but a narrow derived representation cannot hold is a mapping error on the
// derived type — Parse returns it as an *xsderr.Error (the concrete rule ID is
// chosen by the concrete backend that produces the value; no such backend
// exists yet, so the rule is TBD until one lands), never a false validity
// verdict.
//
// Canonical renders a value back to its canonical lexical form. It MAY be nil:
// some types have no canonical mapping at all (QName's is context-dependent and
// the spec defines none per dt-canonical-representation). Callers must treat a
// nil Canonical as "this whole type has no canonical form", not as an error.
//
// Distinct from that whole-type case: even when Canonical is non-nil, it may
// return a plain (non-*xsderr.Error) error for one specific VALID value that has
// no canonical lexical form of its own. A canonical mapping's domain is only
// "(where possible)" the entire value space (dt-canonical-mapping, §2.3.1), so a
// type that inherits a base's canonical mapping under a narrowing pattern facet
// can hold a value whose would-be canonical form falls outside its own lexical
// space (e.g. yearMonthDuration's ·months·=0∧·seconds·=0, whose duration
// canonical "PT0S" is outside the [^DT]* lexical space, §3.4.26.1 Note; any type
// restricting a base's canonical mapping by a pattern facet can hit the same
// trap). Unlike the Parse-side mapping error above, this is NEVER a validity
// verdict — no cvc-* rule reads canonical form (§2.3.1 Note) — so it is a plain
// fmt.Errorf, not an *xsderr.Error. This per-value "valid, no canonical form"
// case stays textually separate from the whole-type "no Canonical func" case.
type Mapping struct {
	// Parse maps a normalized lexical form to a value, or returns an
	// *xsderr.Error describing why the lexical is not in the type's space.

	// types that have no canonical mapping (whole-type case); when non-nil it may

	// canonical form of its own (partial-domain case, §2.3.1's "(where possible)").

// Backend supplies the lexical↔value mappings for builtin types. A backend

// derived builtins to give them their own, typically narrower, representation.
//
// A derived type's own mapping governs only the VALUE the application receives,
// never the space in which inherited facet checks run: enumeration and bound
// facets are always compared in the value space of the type that DECLARES the
// facet, parsed by that type's governing mapping (its own, or its nearest
// mapped ancestor's — ultimately the primitive's, which is the widest). Using a
// narrow derived representation for base-chain semantics would corrupt them
// (overflow, collapsed precision, different ordering). Comparison and facet
// capabilities are not backend methods; they live on the values a Mapping
// produces (see [Ordered], [DigitCounted], …).

//
// The widest-space rule (see [Backend]) still governs: an override changes only
// the value an application receives for the overridden type, not the space in
