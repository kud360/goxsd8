// This file drives the backend-generic facet pipeline: the pattern (lexical)
// and value-facet stages that run after the whiteSpace stage (whitespace.go)
// over an atomic type's effective facets. The fixed stage sequence (doc.go "The
// facet pipeline", ARCHITECTURE.md) is:
//
//	whiteSpace → pattern (lexical) → lexical mapping (Parse) → value facets
//
// Pattern operates on the whiteSpace-normalized LEXICAL literal
// (cvc-pattern-valid, §4.3.4.4); enumeration/bounds/digits/length operate on
// the parsed VALUE (cvc-enumeration-valid §4.3.5.4, cvc-*Inclusive/*Exclusive
// §4.3.7–4.3.10, cvc-totalDigits/fractionDigits §4.3.11–4.3.12,
// cvc-length/minLength/maxLength §4.3.1–4.3.3). Each stage failure carries the
// SPECIFIC per-facet rule ID, never the cvc-facet-valid umbrella (§4.1.4).
//
// Compile-time assertions that the concrete checkers satisfy the pipeline-stage
// interfaces (backend.go): compile builds []LexicalFacet and []ValueFacet and
// ValidateLexical ranges over them polymorphically, so the interface
// satisfaction has real call sites.

// all facet violations). ctx is the VALIDATED INSTANCE's context, threaded to
// the governing mapping's Parse for the candidate value; a context-free cohort
// (decimal/boolean/string) passes nil here.
//
// PRECONDITION (caller-guarded, not PRE-checked here — but a violation is
// reported, see below): every facet on st is applicable to st per
// cos-applicable-facets (§4.1.5), and b maps st's governing type. The
// applicability half of that precondition is DISCHARGED for any st reachable in a
// schema finalized with an xsd.SimpleTypeRestrictionChecker installed, as the
// parser always does (cos-st-restricts clause 1.3.1 for the atomic case, clauses
// 2.2.2.4/3.2.2.4 inside package xsd for list and union). It remains the CALLER's
// to honor for an st assembled through the xsd constructors and finalized without
// that capability, or never finalized at all — so a violated precondition is
// reachable, and it is REPORTED rather than assumed away.
//
// st may be atomic, list or union variety, and EACH is decided end to end — the
// three cases of cvc-datatype-valid clause 2 (§4.1.4). Atomic (cl.2.1) and list
// (cl.2.2) share the pipeline below: both resolve their in-force whiteSpace
// facet, and a list resolves its value exactly as an atomic one does, because
// governingMapping wraps the item TYPE in a listMapping whose Parse recurses
// here per item — so an item is Datatype Valid by the whole rule, the item
// type's own facets included (clause dv_list, list.go). A union (cl.2.3,
// dv_union) takes the separate dispatch path in union.go instead: it carries no
// whiteSpace facet of its own (categorically not applicable, §4.1.5), and its
// literal is decided by its {member type definitions} in order — the first
// member that is itself Datatype Valid is the ·active member type·, its value
// IS the union's value (dv_union's V is a pass-through, never a union-shaped
// wrapper), and the union's own pattern and enumeration facets are applied
// around that dispatch.
//
// A VIOLATED PRECONDITION is returned as an *xsderr.Error that
// [IsFacetPrecondition] reports true for — never as a panic, and never as a
// validity verdict. There are exactly two such states:
//
//   - a value facet paired with a value lacking the CAPABILITY that facet needs: a
//     bound facet on a value that is not [Ordered], a length facet on one that is
//     not [Lengthed], a digit facet on one that is not [DigitCounted], a scale facet
//     on one that is not [Scaled], explicitTimezone on one that is not
//     [TimezoneAware]. Each is a facet sitting in {facets} outside the set §4.1.5
//     permits, so each is charged to cos-applicable-facets. Note the capability is
//     what is missing, not the property: a [TimezoneAware] value with no timezone
//     under a required explicitTimezone facet, and a [Scaled] value whose ·scale· is
//     absent, are ordinary verdicts (a rejection and a vacuous pass), not faults.
//   - an atomic or list st with no usable whiteSpace mode in force — no whiteSpace
//     facet at all, a multi-valued one, or a {value} outside the §4.3.6.1 domain —
//     where §3.16.7.4 and §4.3.6.1 guarantee one. That is charged to
//     [xsderr.RuleComponentInvariant], not to a cvc-* or cos-* ID: §4.3.6.3 states
//     outright that "there are no Validation Rules associated with whiteSpace", and
//     the state it names is a representation invariant of the component rather than
//     any numbered clause (effectiveWhiteSpace).
//
// Neither says anything about rawLexical, so a caller that charges one as a
// validity verdict converts its own construction bug into a FALSE REJECT of a valid
// schema or instance. Inside this package the three deciders discriminate it:
// valueSpace.ValidDefault reports undecided (its gate 4), dispatchUnion aborts the
// member scan instead of folding the fault into its rejection list, and
// checkEnumerationRestriction skips the member instead of re-charging it under
// §4.3.5.5. An external caller does the same through [IsFacetPrecondition].
//
// The three §4.1.5 states in which NO facet is applicable at all are not faults and
// not errors: an absent {variety} (xs:anySimpleType), an atomic {variety} with an
// absent {primitive type definition} (xs:anyAtomicType), and a union, whose
// applicable facets are pattern, enumeration and assertions alone. No whiteSpace
// mode is in force for any of them and none is required, so the normalization stage
// is skipped and the literal is parsed as written.
//
// Facet {value} parsing is a separate concern with its own scope: an inherited
// enumeration/bound facet's lexical {value} is parsed in the DECLARING SCHEMA's
// context (see newEnumFacet/newBoundFacet), which for a context-free cohort is
// nil-equivalent. A QName/NOTATION enumeration member does NOT inherit ctx (the
// validated instance's context): newEnumFacet resolves each member's prefixes
// against the bindings in scope where its <enumeration> was written (§3.3.18),
// carried per member on the facet, never against this instance scope.
// r resolves st's {base type definition} chain, which a compiled schema may
// defer by name (xsd.SimpleTypeOrRef). It is a PARAMETER at this entry point and
// is stored NOWHERE in this package — not on [Backend], not on a compiled facet,
// not on the [xsd.ValueSpace] this package returns — so one backend and one
// value space serve every schema. An unresolvable base surfaces as the
// src-resolve error [xsd.SimpleType.Base] produces, which is neither a validity
// verdict about rawLexical nor a facet-pipeline precondition fault: it says the
// TYPE could not be read at all. A caller resolving against an assembled
// xsd.Schema passes it; one validating against a Schema-less graph passes a stub
// that resolves nothing, which is correct because such a graph carries no
// by-name base to resolve.

//
// The MAPPING is the widest-space rule (st-restrict-facets §3.16.6.4,
// backend.go) for an inherited facet: the governing mapping FROM the declaring
// type (its own, or its nearest mapped ancestor's) — never leaf's. A facet's
// lexical {value} is parsed in the value space of the type that DECLARES it, so
// a narrow derived representation can never corrupt an inherited bound/enum
// comparison (overflow, collapsed precision, different ordering).
//
// The whiteSpace MODE is the one in force on the declaring type's {base type
// definition}, not on the declaring type itself. A facet's {value} is "a value
// from the value space of the {base type definition}" (§4.3.7.1 f-mai-value and
// its siblings, §4.3.5.1 for enumeration), and reaching that value space from the
// facet's XML `value` attribute runs the base type's lexical mapping, whose first
// stage is that type's whiteSpace normalization (key-vv §3.1.3, key-nv §3.1.4,
// cvc-simple-type §3.16.4). A declaring type that overrides whiteSpace on its own
// account (say collapse over a replace base) narrows what its own INSTANCES may
// look like; it does not retroactively renormalize the facet {value}s it writes
// against the base. A zero mode — an unmapped/absent base, or one carrying no
// usable whiteSpace facet (xs:anySimpleType, xs:anyAtomicType, a union) — means
// no normalization applies (whiteSpaceInForce).
//
// Types are matched by QName, and an ANONYMOUS component (the zero QName) is a
// normal inhabitant of a base chain — every builtin list datatype restricts an
// anonymous intermediate list (§3.4.5/§3.4.10/§3.4.12, builtin.Seed), so such a
// node sits between xs:NMTOKENS/xs:IDREFS/xs:ENTITIES and xs:anySimpleType. It is
// never the DECLARING type of a facet reaching here: only enumeration and the
// four bound facets route through this resolution, and §3.16.2.1 map.std.common
// case 3 gives a constructed list exactly one facet, whiteSpace, which the
// normalization stage consumes without consulting Declaring(). A caller that
// nonetheless passed the zero QName would match the nearest anonymous node from
// leaf upward, which is the same nearest-declaration rule a named match gets.
