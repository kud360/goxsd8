// This file holds the SCHEMA-CONSTRUCTION half of the facet machinery: the
// §4.3 Schema Component Constraints whose operands live in a VALUE SPACE and so
// need a Backend, which is exactly the part of cos-st-restricts clause 1.3.2 /
// 2.2.2.5 / 3.2.2.5 that package xsd — a pure leaf that cannot import this
// package — has to leave undone (xsd/derivation.go's checkFacetRestrictions
// charges the count- and token-valued rules there, and the two bound-facet SCCs
// that read no {value}: maxInclusive-maxExclusive and minInclusive-minExclusive,
// which forbid specifying both bounds of one side at one derivation step).
//
// It is the construction-time complement of facets.go: the same four bound
// facets and the same enumeration facet, but comparing a RESTRICTION's facet
// {value}s ONCE, when the type is built, rather than comparing an instance's
// value against those facets on every validated literal. Two SCC families are
// charged here, and they differ in what the derived facet is compared AGAINST:
// the "valid restriction" family compares it against the {base type
// definition}'s facets ACROSS the restriction step, while the "opposite bound"
// family (checkBoundConsistency) compares a lower bound against an upper bound
// declared at the SAME step.
//
// cos-pattern-restriction (§4.3.4.5, "it is an error if there is any member of
// the {value} of the pattern facet on the {base type definition} which is not
// also a member of the {value}") is deliberately NOT checked here: it is a
// structural invariant of xsd.SimpleType, not a runtime condition.
// SimpleType.EffectiveFacets computes {facets} by walking the WHOLE base chain
// and overlaying each level's own facets, and xsd's overlayFacet gives
// FacetPattern keep-both semantics (§4.3.4.2 xr-pattern: patterns at different
// derivation steps are ANDed, so the base's pattern facet survives as its own
// entry beside the derived one) — the base's pattern facet is retained verbatim
// regardless of what a caller supplies as own facets, so every member of its
// {value} is trivially still a member of {facets}. There is no reachable
// violating state to reject.

// The construction-time Schema Component Constraints this file charges: the
// §4.3 "valid restriction" siblings of facets.go's instance-time cvc-* rules,
// then the four same-step "opposite bound" constraints of §4.3.7.4–§4.3.10.4.

//
//   - maxInclusive / maxExclusive / minInclusive / minExclusive valid restriction
//     (§4.3.7.4–§4.3.10.4). Each is a FOUR-WAY cross-check: a derived bound is

//     minExclusive without ever touching the base's minInclusive.
//   - enumeration valid restriction (§4.3.5.5): every member of a derived
//     enumeration facet's {value} must be in the ·value space· of the {base type

//
// It also charges the four same-step opposite-bound SCCs of the same sections —
// minInclusive <= maxInclusive, minExclusive <= maxExclusive, minExclusive <
// maxInclusive, minInclusive < maxExclusive (boundConsistencyViolates). Those
// relate two of t's OWN facets to each other rather than to the base, so they
// are the one charge here that would still have work to do if the base carried
// no facets at all.
//
// It is the value-aware second half of a two-part charge whose entry point is the
// installed xsd.SimpleTypeRestrictionChecker (builtin.NewRestrictionChecker):
// that implementation charges the atomic applicable-facet clause 1.3.1 first and
// then delegates here. A schema finalized with no such checker installed gets
// neither check.
//
// b supplies the value space. When b has NO governing mapping for the base type,
// every comparison below is skipped and CheckFacetRestriction returns nil: an
// unmapped type is a gap in the BACKEND, not an invalidity in the schema, and
// turning it into a rejection would false-reject every schema written against a
// datatype the caller chose not to back. The same gap is still reported — as a
// real cvc-datatype-valid error, not silently — the moment an instance is
// validated against such a type (ValidateLexical).
//
// t's OWN facets are the derived side of every comparison, deliberately: a facet
// t merely INHERITS is the very same facet component the base carries, so

// against the base's own base when the base was constructed. This mirrors
// xsd/derivation.go's checkScaleValueRestriction.
//
// r resolves t's {base type definition}, which a compiled schema may defer by
// name (xsd.SimpleTypeOrRef). Like [ValidateLexical]'s it is a PARAMETER stored
// nowhere — not on restrictionCheck, whose fields are the three resolved facts
// one pass needs and not the capability that produced them. r is also the

// An assertions-facet DECLINE in the base is SKIPPED on the same terms
// (IsAssertionDeclined): this check holds no XPath engine (assertionsUndecided),

// assertions undecided, and charging that would reject every enumeration on a
// base carrying an assertions facet. GAP(value): a member the base's
// assertions would reject is therefore never charged under §4.3.5.5. The
