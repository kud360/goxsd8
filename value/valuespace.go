// This file is the adapter that lets package xsd — a pure leaf that cannot
// import this one (PRINCIPLES 1) — answer the Structures constraints that reach
// into a value space. Two of them COMPARE the {value}s of two Value Constraints:
//
//   - au-props-correct (§3.5.6) clause 3: "U.{value constraint}.{value} is
//     IDENTICAL to U.{attribute declaration}.{value constraint}.{value}" —
//     Datatypes §2.2.1's identity relation.
//   - loc-testSubP (§3.4.6.4) clauses 4.2 and 5.2.2: "an EQUAL OR IDENTICAL
//     value" — the §2.2.1/§2.2.2 union, which §2.2.2 makes the default reading
//     of every sameness test the specification prescribes.
//
// Both are VALUE-space tests, not lexical ones: {value} is an ·actual value·
// (key-vv §3.2.1), so "1" and "01" are the same xs:integer {value} under two
// {lexical form}s, and xsd.ValueConstraint carries only the latter.
//
// The third, cos-valid-simple-default (§3.2.6.2) — charged by a-props-correct
// (§3.2.6.1) clause 2 and au-props-correct clause 2 — is one-sided: it asks
// whether ONE {lexical form} denotes a value of ONE type at all, which is
// Datatype Valid (§4.1.4) and so [ValidateLexical]'s whole job. It needs no
// shared mapping across two types, so it decides the list and union varieties
// the comparisons refuse; what it must NOT do is turn the pipeline's non-verdict
// errors into rejections (ValidDefault says which, and why).

// NewValueSpace returns the [xsd.ValueSpace] backed by b: it maps a Value
// Constraint's {lexical form} through the governing mapping of the type that
// constrains it, compares the resulting values with the capability relations the
// values themselves carry ([Identical], [Eq]), and validates one against its type
// through the full facet pipeline ([ValidateLexical]).
//
// It honors the fail-open contract [xsd.ValueSpace] states: every question it
// cannot answer reports decided=false rather than a verdict, so an unsupported
// type, an unmappable lexical, a cross-type comparison, or an error that belongs
// to the type rather than to the value constraint can never turn into a schema
// rejection.
//
// It panics if b is nil, matching parser.WithBackend's guard: a nil backend is a
// caller bug, not a schema-validity condition.

// vc.{lexical form} Datatype Valid (§4.1.4) with respect to t? [ValidateLexical]
// decides exactly that rule — all three of its clauses, over all three varieties
// — so the whole of this method is the two gates that separate the errors it
// returns which ARE that verdict from the ones that are not. Every gate answers
// undecided, never invalid, per the [xsd.ValueSpace] fail-open contract. A
// verdict rides out as the returned cause, unmodified and still carrying its own
// cvc-* rule; an error a gate catches is discarded with it.
//
// The first gate runs BEFORE the pipeline; the second reads the pipeline's own
// error through the ONE classification this package publishes:
//
//  1. GAP(value): needsContext. A QName- or NOTATION-governed value space
//     anywhere in t's variety closure needs the namespace bindings in scope at
//     the literal (§3.3.18/§3.3.19, PRINCIPLES 19). vc now CARRIES those
//     bindings, and the comparisons resolve them (sharedMapping), so what is
//     still unclaimed here is the routing: this method does not refuse the list
//     and union varieties, and threading a [Context] to the literal through
//     validateUnion and listMapping — which re-derive their own dispatch — is a
//     rejection surface of its own (a list OF QName, a union WITH a QName
//     member), with its own grounding and its own ratchet attribution. Until
//     that lands the whole closure stays undecided, because a nil [Context]
//     makes a backend reject EVERY QName lexical and every QName default would
//     be a false reject.
//  2. [IsDatatypeVerdict]. An ungoverned type, a construction-stage failure in
//     t's facets, a facet-pipeline precondition fault and an unresolvable base
//     are each a fault of T or of the backend, and each would be reported for
//     EVERY literal — so reading one as clause 2 would reject the schema under a
//     rule with nothing to say about it, for a default no lexical could have
//     satisfied. That predicate names the whole class and why each member
//     belongs to it; this method does not re-derive the list, which is what the
//     three separate pre-check gates it replaced amounted to.
//
// One residue is recorded rather than papered over. GAP(value): union member
// facet compilation. dispatchUnion folds every member's rejection into one
// cvc-datatype-valid error of its own, so a construction-stage failure in a
// MEMBER's facets loses its marking on the way out and still reaches the caller
// as a decided reject. The LIST half of that residue is already closed:
// listMapping's Parse recurses through validateLexical, which marks an item
// type's fault, and the marking survives the item error's propagation out of
// Parse.
//
// The error model no longer stands in the way of closing the union half: the
// marking now exists, and dispatchUnion already aborts its member scan on one
// class of fault ([IsFacetPrecondition]) — widening that test to the whole class
// is the change. What is left is not difficulty but ATTRIBUTION. Widening it
// turns member faults from decided rejects into declines, which moves verdicts
// and so may move a lane, and that movement belongs to the issue that owns the
// residue (#462) rather than being absorbed here where it would be credited to
// an unrelated landing (PRINCIPLES 22).
//
// nil is passed as the [Context] because gate 1 has already excluded every
// context-dependent literal — unlike values, which parses each side under the
// context its own value constraint captured.

// be answered, on the same fail-open terms [ValidDefault] states, so a caller can
// never charge a violation off a fault of the type or of the backend.
//
// Both sides are validated against t itself, so no shared-mapping search is needed
// (contrast values, which compares two DIFFERENT types' constraints): one type
// fixes one governing mapping and one whiteSpace mode, and running each side

// in scope where its own {lexical form} was written in the schema document
// (§3.3.18, constraintContext). One shared context would decide a QName agreement
// wrongly in both directions.
//
// A side that fails to validate is undecided, never a mismatch. For the instance
// side that is not a lost verdict: a literal outside t's lexical space already
// fails cvc-attribute clause 3, which the caller charges in its own right, and
// reporting "not the same value" for what is really "not a value at all" would
// charge clause 4 as well for one defect. For vc's side it is the schema's own

//
// The one space is the shared governing mapping of ta and tb (sharedMapping).
// Each side is whiteSpace-normalized under ITS OWN type's effective mode before
// being parsed, because normalization is the first stage of that type's lexical
// mapping (key-nv §3.1.4, cvc-simple-type §3.16.4) and a restriction may narrow
// the mode its base declared. A type with no mode in force (xs:anySimpleType, a
// union) yields the zero mode, which normalizeWhiteSpace refuses, so it is
// reported undecided instead.
//
// Each side is also parsed under ITS OWN [Context], built from the namespace
// bindings that side's value constraint captured where its {lexical form} was
// written (§3.3.18/§3.3.19, PRINCIPLES 19). The two literals may come from
// schema documents binding the same prefix differently, or different prefixes
// to one namespace, so a single shared context would decide the comparison

//
// A Parse failure is undecided, never a verdict: a {lexical form} outside the

// such a literal already fails Datatype Valid, so cos-valid-simple-default
// clause 1 rejects the schema before either comparison is asked anything. What
// it must not become is a NOT-same verdict, which every consumer of these two
// methods charges on — xsd's checkAttributeUseValueConstraint
// (valueconstraintvalid.go, au-props-correct clause 3),
// fixedValueConstraintSubsumes and attributeValueConstraintsAgree
// (defaultbinding.go, loc-testSubP clauses 4.2 and 5.2.2) each reject on
// decided-and-not-same and accept on undecided — so a wrong NOT-same here is a

// sharedMapping resolves the ONE Mapping that governs both ta's and tb's values,

// ·derived· from G's, so a general xs:decimal and a specific xs:integer routinely
// meet here.
//
// The widest-space rule (doc.go, backend.go) is what makes such a pair
// comparable at all: a derived type without its own mapping is governed by its
// nearest mapped ancestor's, so xs:integer and xs:byte both resolve to whatever
// governs them upward, and Datatypes §2.2.1's own note settles the semantics —
// "'+2', treated as a decimal, '+2', treated as an integer, and '+2', treated as
// a byte, all denote the same value. They are not only equal but identical."
//
// When the two sides resolve to DIFFERENT governing types the comparison is
// refused. That is not conservatism, it is §2.2.1/§2.2.2's own rule: "values
// from different ·primitive· datatypes' ·value spaces· are made artificially
// distinct", and a backend's derived mapping may in addition represent values in
// a narrower space of its own, where a value of the base space has no image.
// Parsing each side under its own mapping and comparing the results across the
// two would be exactly the corruption the widest-space rule forbids, and could
// report a spurious NOT-same — the one outcome the fail-open contract rules out.
//
// The list and union varieties are refused outright, on ta or tb: their governing
// mappings are synthesized per type (listMapping over the {item type definition},
// unionMapping over the {member type definitions}), so "the same mapping"
// is not a property two distinct nodes can be checked for by identity here, and
// no comparison is better than a guessed one.
//
// The two context-dependent primitives, QName and NOTATION, are NOT refused:
// each side's value constraint carries the namespace bindings in scope AT ITS
// LITERAL (§3.3.18/§3.3.19, PRINCIPLES 19), which values resolves each side's
// prefix under, so "a:x" and "b:x" compare SAME when both prefixes name one
// namespace and "p:x" compares NOT-same across documents that bind "p"
// differently — the two verdicts a lexical comparison gets wrong in opposite
// directions. The prefix that resolves to nothing is values' residual, marked
// there.
//
