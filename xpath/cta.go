// clause 2.1 (§3.12.6) fixes, productions [8] ta-Test through [18]
// ta-ConstructorFunction — and nothing wider, but for the two productions the
// assertion façade adds and the Type Alternative one declines: [11]'s
// Comparator position also takes xpath20.md [23] ValueComp ('eq' | 'ne' | 'lt'
// | 'le' | 'gt' | 'ge'), evaluated as §3.5.1's value comparison
// (ctaValueCompare), and [16] SimpleValue also takes [44] VarRef ('$' VarName),
// of which only `$value` is in scope (cvc-assertion clause 2.2), a child-axis
// step naming one of E's element [[children]] (ctaTypedChild, or
// ctaUntypedChild for a child of mixed content), and a "/" or
// "//" opening a path, which raises (ctaNoDocumentRoot); the whole operand of
// fn:exists, fn:empty or an ·effective boolean value· also takes a relative
// path of two or more such steps (ctaChildPath) and one element step `N`,
// `./N` or `.//N` whatever N's type (ctaSelectedElements); and [14] ValueExpr
// also takes an fn:count call over one counted path (ctaCount) — a child step
// in it filtered by one [40] Predicate testing attribute existence
// (ctaFilteredChildren) or comparing the child's value (ctaMatchingChildren,
// whose `.` is ctaCandidate), and two or more such paths joined by [21]
// UnionExpr (ctaUnion) — or over an operand that is no path, such as
// `$value`, whose items it counts (ctaCountedItems), and a call to one of the
// F&O string and sequence functions or to fn:namespace-uri over E
// (ctaNamespaceURI), evaluated in ctafunc.go, and [11] ta-BooleanExpr a
// comparison by `=` of fn:in-scope-prefixes over E against string literals
// (ctaPrefixMember), whose `.` is E as a node (ctaContextNode); and each
// comparison operand may be xpath20.md [13] AdditiveExpr over [14]
// MultiplicativeExpr, whose operators are evaluated in ctaarith.go (ctaArith);
// [47] ContextItemExpr `.`, atomized to E's string value (ctaContextAtom);
// xpath20.md [18] CastableExpr's `castable as` tail in place of [15]'s `cast
// as` one (ctaCastable); xpath20.md [16] InstanceofExpr's `instance of` tail
// with an atomic SequenceType over a [14] ta-ValueExpr or an fn:data call
// (ctaInstanceOf); and a general comparison's operand may be an integer
// sequence, xpath20.md [11] RangeExpr or §3.3.1's comma sequence over
// IntegerLiterals, or a string sequence, §3.3.1's comma sequence over
// StringLiterals, evaluated in ctasequence.go (ctaIntegerRanges,
// ctaStringSequence). The facet façade (ctaFacetFacade) takes the assertion
// façade's grammar but fn:count over a path, and compiles every read of the
// context item — `.`, an attribute or child step, a rooted path — to the
// err:XPDY0002 an assertions facet's absent context item raises
// (ctaNoContextItem). It is not a stage of a general XPath 2.0 evaluator: the
// productions below reach no axis but attribute, one child step, the child-step
// paths and the one descendant step whose existence is asked and the descendant
// steps fn:count counts over, no predicate or union but those in an fn:count
// argument, no variable but `$value` and no function but fn:not, fn:count, the
// ctaParser.libraryCall names, fn:in-scope-prefixes as an operand of `=`
// (ctaParser.prefixMember) and fn:data as the operand of `instance of`
// (ctaParser.instanceofExpr), so evaluating them directly is exact where a

// THREE ERROR DIRECTIONS MEET HERE AND NO TWO OF THEM ARE ONE.
//
// A test the engine cannot evaluate is declined at COMPILE time
// ([CompileCTATest] reporting false), and its consequence — the caller
// withholding the element's ·governing type definition· — is argued at that
// caller (validate/cta.go). A dynamic or type error inside a test the engine
// CAN evaluate is a decided false, because key-cta-ta-select clause 2
// (§3.12.4) says so: "If a dynamic error or a type error is raised during
// evaluation, then the {test} is treated as if it had evaluated (without
// error) to false." That is spec-normative behavior and not this module's
// fail-open contract, so it carries no GAP marker and never reaches the
// caller as a decline. An XPath STATIC error is neither: it is a
// ta-props-correct clause 2 (§3.12.6) violation the assembler charges before
// any instance exists, reported by [CTATestStaticError] and by nothing else in
// this package.
//
// The nodes of the XDM instance a {test} runs against are UNTYPED
// (key-cta-ta-select clause 1's Note), so an UNCAST attribute operand
// atomizes to xs:untypedAtomic and xpath20.md §3.5.2's untypedAtomic casting
// rules are the normal path of every comparison here rather than an edge
// case. The Note also names the remedy the grammar gives a test that needs
// type information — "explicit casts will sometimes be necessary" — which is
// [15]'s cast tail and [18]'s constructor function, both evaluated here.
//
// EVERY CAST IS A DATATYPE VALIDATION. xpath-functions.md §17.1.1 fixes that
// outright for an xs:string or xs:untypedAtomic operand: "Whitespace
// normalization is applied as indicated by the whiteSpace facet for the
// datatype. The resulting whitespace-normalized string must be a valid
// lexical form for the datatype. The semantics of casting are identical to
// XML Schema validation." So a cast is [value.ValidateLexical] — the whole
// facet pipeline, whiteSpace and pattern and value facets included — and
// never a lexical parser of this package's own (STYLE T4).

// Attributes yields the attributes of the element information item E whose
// ·selected type definition· is being decided — §3.12.4 clause 1.1.2's copy of
// E.[[attributes]], plus clause 1.1.3's non-clashing [[inherited attributes]] —
// each as its ·expanded name· and its [[normalized value]], in DOCUMENT ORDER.
// It must be non-nil, and a yield reporting false ends the walk.
//
// It is the ONE way this package reads an attribute, whatever NameTest [17]
// ta-AttrName carries: a QName NameTest filters this sequence to the one
// ·expanded name· it names, and each [37] Wildcard arm filters it its own way,
// so no second entry point encodes "read an attribute" a second time (STYLE
// D4).
//
// The sequence a NameTest matches is the operand xpath20.md §3.5.2 quantifies
// a general comparison over: true only when "there is a pair of atomic values,
// one in the first operand sequence and the other in the second", so a
// comparison matching NO attribute is false; §3.10.2 rule 3 makes that same
// empty sequence a type error (err:XPTY0004) under a `cast as T` written
// without the `?` occurrence indicator, and a matched sequence of two or more
// is err:XPTY0004 under any cast at all. That is neither a decline nor an error
// to the caller in any of those cases.
//
// The lexical is the attribute's [[normalized value]]: XML 1.0 §3.3.3
// attribute-value normalization applied, whiteSpace-facet normalization NOT —
// the latter belongs to the type a cast targets, and [CTATest.Evaluate]
// applies it per target type.

// CompileCTATest compiles the {test} of a Type Alternative (§3.12.1, an
// [xsd.XPathExpression] property record) into an evaluable [CTATest],

//
// types resolves every QName the expression names a datatype with — [15]
// ta-CastExpr's target, [18] ta-ConstructorFunction's function name, and the
// builtin types §3.5.2's casting rules answer with — and is read here and
// stored nowhere: the compiled tree holds the resolved *[xsd.SimpleType]
// components themselves, which is why [CTATest.Evaluate] takes a resolver
// again rather than reading one off the tree.
//
// ok false is the WITHHOLD direction and covers every such {expression} under
// one encoding, because they all have one consequence at the caller:
//
//   - text that is not a [8] ta-Test production at all. A legal full XPath 2.0
//     {test} looks exactly like this to a restricted-subset parser, and
//     ta-props-correct and xpath-valid (§3.13.6.2) are SCHEMA component
//     constraints charged at assembly by their owner, which reads this module
//     through [CTATestStaticError] and never through this entry point — so
//     nothing upstream has narrowed what arrives here and an error return would
//     be a false reject of every schema using full XPath in conditional type
//     assignment;
//   - a prefix with no binding in the record's {namespace bindings}
//     (err:XPST0081), which is a STATIC error and so not clause 2's false;
//   - a comparison whose two operands need a type promotion this engine cannot
//     perform, which today is exactly B.1 rule 1.1's xs:float to xs:double
//     (ctaWider). Declining is what keeps the withhold and the DECIDED false
//     apart: a promotion that cannot be performed is not err:XPTY0004 and must
//     not become one, because that error is a decided false the caller reads as
//     "this alternative did not select";
//   - a cast target this engine does not cast to, which is TWO conditions
//     sharing one encoding deliberately. A target naming an in-scope atomic
//     type outside the XSD namespace is valid XPath outside §3.12.6's
//     required subset, which that section's own Note licenses a processor to
//     decline ("Conforming processors may but are not required to support
//     XPath expressions not belonging to the required subset of XPath"); a
//     target that resolves to nothing, to a complex type, to a non-atomic
//     type or to xs:anyAtomicType/xs:NOTATION is err:XPST0051/err:XPST0080, a
//     STATIC error and so an xpath-valid clause 2 failure. The encoding
//     tracks the CONSEQUENCE, and both consequences are the one withhold
//     validate/cta.go's conditionallySelected argues: the element's
//     ·governing type definition· is not determined, and no type is assessed
//     against in its place;
//   - a cast of a numeric literal that F&O §17 does not define over its
//     ·canonical representation·, the one cast this façade declines for its
//     OPERAND (ctaTypes.castsFrom, literalCastsTo): a DoubleLiteral to any
//     target but xs:double, such as `xs:string(1.5e0)`, and an IntegerLiteral
//     or a DecimalLiteral to a target outside the string family, xs:float,
//     xs:double, xs:decimal and — for an IntegerLiteral — xs:integer's
//     branch, such as `xs:integer(1.5)` or `xs:boolean(2)`. To a target F&O
//     §17.1's casting table marks Y or M from the literal's type, §17.1.2,
//     §17.1.3 and §17.1.6 define the cast over the value, not over the
//     canonical lexical this engine would re-validate, and it is valid XPath
//     with a defined result; to a target it marks N, such as
//     `xs:date(1.5e0)` or `xs:anyURI(1.5)`, §17.1 raises err:XPTY0004, a type
//     error, which this façade declines too rather than raising — a withhold,
//     as the defined result's decline is.
//
// It never returns an error: a decline is not a verdict about the schema. The
// verdict the STATIC errors two of those bullets name does carry is
// [CTATestStaticError]'s to report, over the same traversal and disagreeing
// with nothing here — this entry point still withholds them, because a tree
// built over an unresolved name or an unadmitted cast target is not evaluable
// whatever the schema's fate. Of the two, only the unbound prefix is reported
// today; the cast-target conditions are folded into this withhold and reach no
// charge, under the marker ctaTypes.castTarget carries.
//
// The static context is xpath-valid clause 2.2's: XPath 1.0 compatibility mode
// false (2.2.1), statically known namespaces from expr.NamespaceBindings()
// (2.2.2), the default element/type namespace from expr.DefaultNamespace()
// (2.2.3) and the default function namespace
// http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions (2.2.4). The default element/type
// namespace is read only where [xsd.XPathExpression.DefaultNamespace] reports
// it present, because that accessor's own doc makes the first result "not
// meaningful" otherwise; an ABSENT one leaves ctaNames.defaultNamespace the
// empty string, which is the no-namespace answer §3.10.2 wants. A Type
// Alternative's {test} consults it for an unprefixed cast TARGET and for
// nothing else (xpath20.md §3.10.2: "If the target type has no namespace
// prefix, it is considered to be in the default element/type namespace"): [17]
// ta-AttrName makes every NameTest its grammar reaches an attribute-axis one,
// whose principal node kind is never element, so an unprefixed NameTest is
// always in no namespace (xpath20.md §3.2.1.2, PRINCIPLES 15), and a child-axis
// step, whose NameTest would read it, is the assertion façade's and declined
// here (ctaFacade.child).

// Constraint, decided when the component is assembled and independent of
// whether any instance is ever ·assessed·, so the charge belongs to the

// wraps what this returns as the cause. The CODE is this package's, because
// err:XPST0081 is XPath's static error and not the assembler's rule, so the

//   - a TYPED attribute, each typed child, a LITERAL, an fn:count call's
//     xs:integer, each item of an integer or string sequence and each item of
//     `$value` carry their own type and are converted to c, which is a no-op
//     wherever the two coincide; the statically empty `$value` yields nothing
//     to convert.
//   - an F&O function's result is of its own result type — an
//     fn:distinct-values call's items of the type it compares them in —
//     and converted to c on the typed operands' terms, once the function has
//     been applied to its arguments (ctafunc.go).

//     of an absent context item, or of an absent focus by fn:position or
//     fn:last, err:XPDY0002.
//   - an ARITHMETIC result is of its own result type and converted to c on
//     the typed operands' terms, once its operands have been converted into
//     its operation type and computed (ctaArithItem).
//   - a CAST evaluates its operand IN THE TARGET TYPE first, because that cast
//     is the expression the author wrote and its failure is the author's
//     err:FORG0001, and only then converts the result to c. Evaluating it
//     straight into c instead would let `@n cast as xs:integer` accept "3.5"
//     whenever the comparison happened to run in xs:double.
//   - a CASTABLE expression evaluates its cast in the target type, as a cast
//     does, and converts the xs:boolean of whether it raised to c
//     (ctaCastableItem).
//   - an INSTANCE OF expression counts its atomized operand's items and
