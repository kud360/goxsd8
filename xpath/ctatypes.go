// builtin datatype a Literal carries, which type a comparison's two operands
// are converted into (xpath20.md §3.5.2's casting rules and B.1's type
// promotions), and whether B.2 admits the operator over that type at all.
// Nothing here runs at evaluation time — the compiled tree holds the resolved
// *[xsd.SimpleType] components and no resolver (ARCHITECTURE), so
// [CTATest.Evaluate] takes one again.

// ctaBuiltin is the ·expanded name· of a builtin datatype, which is the key an
// [xsd.TypeResolver] holds it under. Every call site names a literal builtin
// local (STYLE T4's parallel-table concern does not arise: there is no second
// table, only QName construction for an identity comparison the caller
// already knows the answer to) — this is not a general classifier for an
// arbitrary resolved name, and a schema is free to declare its OWN types with
// `targetNamespace` set to the XSD namespace (produce_typetable.go's
// ctaStaticTypes resolves against the fixed builtin set for exactly that

//     declining exactly that: "Conforming processors may but are not required
//     to support XPath expressions not belonging to the required subset of
//     XPath."
//   - a name resolving to nothing, to a complex type, to a non-atomic type
//     (xs:anySimpleType, and the list builtins xs:IDREFS, xs:NMTOKENS,
//     xs:ENTITIES), or to xs:anyAtomicType or xs:NOTATION is a STATIC error:
//     err:XPST0051 for "the target type must be an atomic type that is in the
//     in-scope schema types", and err:XPST0080 for the two named exclusions.
//
// GAP(xpath): the XPST0051/XPST0080 arm is folded into the compile-time
// withhold and xpath-valid cl. 2 is NOT charged for it — the one static
// condition [CTATestStaticError] proves is err:XPST0081, and proving this one
// takes a parse that runs PAST the failed target to the end of a [8] ta-Test,
// which "unsupported dominates static" requires and which no target stands in
// for: an unbound prefix carries on under ctaUnresolvedName because a QName has
// a zero value the grammar cannot write, and a *[xsd.SimpleType] has none. The
// classification the charge would need is not this arm either, since the second
// bullet above declines a user-defined atomic target as outside the required
// subset while xpath-valid clause 2.2.5 puts only the BUILT-INS in scope — a
// target that is out of scope there is err:XPST0051 rather than declinable, and
// which reading governs wants its own grounding before either becomes a
// rejection. Under-charging is a rejection this engine can take later;
// over-charging is a false reject now. (#894)
//
// GAP(xpath): a target whose {primitive type definition} is xs:QName is

// xs:string:
//
//   - a TYPED operand read off the instance or computed from it — an attribute
//     (ctaTypedAttr), a child element (ctaTypedChild), `$value` (ctaValueVar,
//     each item of a listed one), a count of its nodes (ctaCount, xs:integer),
//     the result of arithmetic (ctaArith, its B.2 result type,
//     arithmeticResult), of a castable or instance-of expression (ctaCastable,
//     ctaInstanceOf, xs:boolean) or of an F&O function call (ctaMatch and
//     ctaPresence, xs:boolean; ctaUnaryString, xs:integer or xs:string;
//     ctaStringFunction, xs:string; ctaDistinctValues, its typed operand's
//     type, a literal's included; ctaCurrentDate, xs:date), or a cast of one
//     of them, or of an operand the second shape names, that is not in the
//     string family (castSource, its target);
//   - a cast of any other shape whose target is xs:float or xs:double
//     (floatingSource): a cast to either over an untyped operand, a
//     string-family one or a literal other than a DoubleLiteral, as in
//     `string(xs:float('1.5'))` or `string(xs:double(@s))` over an xs:string
//     @s.
//
// Every other operand casts as [CompileCTATest] states, the statically empty
// `$value` (ctaEmptyValue) among them: it holds no item to convert. So do the
// xs:untypedAtomic operands — an attribute (ctaAttr) or `$value`
// (ctaUntypedValue) of ·special· type, and a child of mixed content
// (ctaUntypedChild) — each item of which a cast to any target validates as a
// lexical of that target (F&O §17.1.1).
//
// Three typed operands are admitted:
//
//   - the string family, to any target, because xpath-functions.md §17.1.1
//     makes a cast from xs:string one datatype validation of the value's own
//     string, which ctaPromote performs exactly: the ·canonical
//     representation· of an xs:string value is that string (f-stringCanmap);
//   - an operand whose type is target itself or derived from it by
//     restriction, at any depth: F&O §17.2 case 4, "When SV is an instance of
//     the TT, the cast always succeeds (Identity cast)", and §17.3, "it is
//     always possible to cast a value of any atomic type to an atomic type from
//     which it is derived, directly or indirectly, by restriction ... The
//     result will have the same value as the original". ctaPromote hands the
//     value on unrendered wherever it already is one of target's
//     (ctaRepresents). Every typed operand above is atomic and its
//     base chain is restriction alone (typedAtomic, valueVariable), and
//     castTarget has already excluded xs:NOTATION, xs:anyAtomicType and every
//     non-atomic target, the exclusions §17.3 and §3.10.2 make. The relation is
//     the operand's type below the target and never the reverse, nor a shared
//     primitive: `xs:integer(@d)` over an xs:decimal @d is §17.4's, not §17.3's;
//   - an operand whose {primitive type definition} is xs:date, xs:dateTime or
//     xs:time (localValueSource), to xs:string itself: §17.1.2 makes TV "the
//     local value", its components rendered with the timezone "if present",
//     which is the ·canonical representation· ctaPromote renders — offset 0 as
//     `Z`, any other as its signed hh:mm (timezoneCanonicalFragmentMap), never
//     UTC-shifted, no trailing fractional zeros, and midnight as 00:00:00,
//     never "24".
//
// Both cast spellings, and `castable as`, take a [16] ta-SimpleValue operand,
// so a count, an arithmetic, castable or function result and a cast reach
// castsFrom only as fn:string's argument (ctaParser.stringOf), whose target
// is xs:string: of those, the second rule admits nothing the first does not,
// and the third admits one whose type has a date/time primitive, as
// `string(xs:date(@d))` and fn:distinct-values over a typed date/time operand
// do.
//
// GAP(xpath): a cast from any OTHER typed operand, a literal aside, is
// declined — §17.4's cast within a branch of the hierarchy that is not to an
// ancestor, and §17.1's and §17.5's casts across primitives — because
// xpath-functions.md §17 defines those over the VALUE, not over a re-validated
// canonical lexical: xs:decimal to xs:integer truncates (§17.1.3.4) where the
// round-trip ctaPromote would perform raises err:FORG0001 for "3.5", and an
// assertion a raised cast makes false is a charge (cvc-assertion), so the
// round-trip would fabricate one. An xs:float or xs:double operand, a
// DoubleLiteral included (literalCastsTo), is the same case: §17.1.2 renders a
// value of absolute value in [0.000001,
// 1000000) as an xs:decimal, so `xs:string(1.5e0)` is "1.5" where ctaPromote
// would render "1.5E0", and §17.1.3 casts it to xs:decimal or xs:integer by its
// value, which the canonical "1.5E0" fails to validate as. Those value-defined
// casts are to the targets F&O §17.1's casting table marks Y or M from xs:float
// and xs:double: xs:untypedAtomic, xs:string, the numerics and xs:boolean
// (§17.1.6). To every target it marks N — the durations, the date/time and g*
// types, the binaries and xs:anyURI — §17.1 makes the cast err:XPTY0004, a type
// error with no value defined, and it declines too: a withhold where the
// round-trip had decided it, raising for `xs:date(1.5e0)` and succeeding for
// `xs:anyURI(1.5e0)`, "1.5E0" being an xs:anyURI lexical. fn:string over such an
// operand, a node of such a type included, is that cast to xs:string and
// declines with it. A date/time operand's cast to a target derived from
// xs:string, and a g* or duration operand's cast to xs:string, are withheld
// only for scope: §17.5 and §17.1.2 define each over the canonical
// representation ctaPromote renders, and admitting them is a widening of
// localValueSource's set or of its target test, not a new renderer (#1042).

// It answers both a comparison (shared) and an arithmetic operator
// (ctaTypes.arithmetic), whose operation type is this same promotion; the
// latter also asks it of two operands sharing one primitive, which is then
// the answer.
//
// GAP(xpath): the xs:float against xs:double pair is DECLINED rather than
// compared or computed, because reaching it needs B.1 rule 1.1 and this engine cannot
// perform rule 1.1. That rule promotes the xs:float operand to "the xs:double
// value that is the same as the original value" — the same point of the real
// line, not a re-parse of any lexical — and value exposes no such widening:
// over the strict backend an xs:float value and an xs:double value answer Eq
// false and Cmp value.Incomparable, correctly, because they are values of
// different types. ctaPromote's ·canonical representation· round-trip is not
// that widening either: xs:float's canonical is the shortest decimal that
// round-trips to the FLOAT, so reparsing it as an xs:double lands on a
// DIFFERENT xs:double. (Rule 1.2's xs:decimal promotion IS "created by
// casting", so the same round-trip is exactly right for the decimal pairs and
// they stay admitted.) The direction is [CompileCTATest]'s withhold: the
