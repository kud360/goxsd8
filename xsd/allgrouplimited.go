// Particle with {max occurs} = 1 which is the {particle} of a complex type's
// {content type} (clause 1.2), or as the {term} of a {min occurs} = {max occurs}
// = 1 Particle among another all group's {particles} (clause 1.3); and every
// particle of an all group whose {term} is a model group has an all group there
// (clause 2).
const ruleCosAllLimited xsderr.Rule = "cos-all-limited"

// This file decides cos-all-limited, both clauses, over the resolved component
// graph. It is a Schema Component Constraint (§2.3, §2.4) stated entirely in
// terms of {term}/{particles}/{compositor}, never over the <all>/<sequence>/
// <group ref> XML spelling — and §3.7.2 (xr.mgd3) makes the {term} of a <group
// ref> particle BE the referenced definition's {model group}, so the compositor
// a usage site imposes is invisible until references resolve. That is why the
// charge lives here and not in the producer (#469).
//
// SCOPE is every {term} slot in the assembled set, reached from three roots —
// the complex type definitions, the top-level element declarations (whose inline
// anonymous complex types no index holds), and the model group definitions. A
// <group ref> is a LEAF: its placement is decided on the referenced definition's
// {model group}, but that group's own {particles} are not descended here,
// because checkAllGroupsLimited walks every definition in its own right. Nothing
// else would be reached by descending, and descending would re-charge one
// component once per reference to it.
//
// Clause 1.1 is why a definition body is never charged: an all-bodied <group
// name="..."> is legal in itself, and the violation is always at a usage site.
//
// PROCESSOR-SYNTHESIZED CONTENT IS IN SCOPE, deliberately. §3.4.2.3.3 clause
// 4.2.3.3 wraps (·base particle·, ·effective content·) in a synthesized sequence
// (extensioncontenttype.go), so extending an all-content base with non-all
// content yields an all group inside a sequence that no author wrote. Neither
// §3.4.2.3.3, nor §3.8.6.2 itself, nor cos-ct-extends (§3.4.6.2, whose clause
// 1.4.3.2.2.2 positively PERMITS the shape through cos-particle-extend clause 2)
// carves out an exemption, and §3.8.6.2 is worded over the resulting component
// with no qualification by origin. So the shape is charged, which is what makes
// "extend a type whose content model is an <all>" an error rather than a
// silently accepted content model no instance can satisfy as the author meant.

// checkAllGroupsLimited is the cos-all-limited step of Phase C. It runs FIRST in
// that phase: the shape clause 2 forbids — a sequence or choice group among an
// all group's {particles} — is one the UPA construction's all-group exit state
// over-approximates on (particleattribution.go), so charging the right rule
// before cos-nonambig sees it keeps that approximation unreachable (#468).
//
// It walks the compiled set in document order (STYLE D2) and returns the first
// violation. Following <group ref> edges needs no cycle guard: Phase B's
// checkModelGroupsAcyclic has already rejected a circular reference graph
// (PRINCIPLES 9), and the descent below follows only OWNED, by-value nesting.
