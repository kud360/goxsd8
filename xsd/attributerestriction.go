// This file renders the ATTRIBUTE half of Derivation Valid (Restriction,
// Complex) clause 3 (Structures §3.4.6.3, c-ran) over the two properties the
// clause actually reads — {attribute uses} and {attribute wildcard} — rather
// than over the Complex Type Definition that usually carries them. Two
// constraints invoke that clause, and only one of them has a complex type to
// hand:
//
//   - derivation-ok-restriction itself, for a complex type restricting its
//     {base type definition} (checkRestrictionAttributes, complexderivation.go);
//   - src-redefine clause 7.2.2 (§4.2.4), which words the invocation as a ROLE
//     SUBSTITUTION — the redefining attribute group's two properties "viewed as
//     the {attribute uses} and {attribute wildcard} of a Complex Type
//     Definition", the redefined document's definition's "viewed as … of the
//     {base type definition}" — and mints no component to view them through
//     (checkAttributeGroupRedefinitions, redefinition.go).
//
// One encoding serves both (STYLE T4): the two property pairs, the rule and
// position to charge, and the prose each side is named by travel together as an
// attributeRestriction, and nothing below reads a type definition. What each
// caller supplies, and whether either side's sets are materialised by a fold,
// is the CALLER's fact and is stated in the caller's own doc — the two differ,
// and c-ran clause 3 is indifferent to the difference.

// attributeRestrictionSide is one side of c-ran clause 3: the {attribute uses}
// and {attribute wildcard} it quantifies over, plus the phrase a message names
// their owner by. The label is not decoration (STYLE E1): on the src-redefine
// path the two sides share an expanded name — a redefinition redefines the name
// it replaces — so the phrase is the only thing in the message that tells them
// apart.
//
// The wildcard is a value plus a present flag, mirroring the AttributeWildcard()
// (Wildcard, bool) accessor both component kinds already expose. The flag is the
// property's ·absent· and is not derivable from the value, since a present
// wildcard may be the zero record.

// checkAttributeRestrictionWildcard is the cvc-complex-type clause 2.2 (c-avaw)
// half of c-ran: the names an element valid against T may carry WITHOUT a
// matching {attribute use} are exactly those T's {attribute wildcard} admits, and
// B must admit each of them too — through its own {attribute wildcard}, since no
// finite {attribute uses} set covers the open name set a wildcard admits.
//
// So the obligation is a relation between the two wildcards, and it is decided by
// wildcardSubset — Wildcard Subset (§3.10.6.2, cos-ns-subset), the ONE encoding of
// that relation in this package (namespaceconstraint_subset.go, shared with the
// element-side transition test in contentrestricts.go; STYLE T4). The direction
// is T's constraint as sub and B's as super: T may admit fewer names than B, never
// more. A T with no {attribute wildcard} admits nothing this way and discharges
// the clause vacuously, which is why the absent case returns before B is read.
//
// Neither side walks a base chain, and for the complex-type caller §3.4.2.5 is
// what makes that exact: a restriction's {attribute wildcard} is its ·complete
// wildcard· (clause 2.1) and an extension's is already the union of its own with
// its base's, materialised at finalize (attributewildcardfold.go, clause 2.2).
// Before that fold, a B that inherited its wildcard read as having none and this
// check FALSELY rejected its restrictions; the fold is what makes the comparison
// sound, not merely more complete.
//
// What the comparison ranges over is names WITHOUT a matching {attribute use},
// and that restriction is cvc-complex-type clause 2's own dispatch rather than a
// refinement of it: clause 2.2 is reached only "otherwise", once clause 2.1
// (c-ctma) has failed to find an attribute use of the item's expanded name, and
// §3.4.4.2's Note states the precedence unconditionally — "the attribute use
// always takes precedence, and the assessment of such items stands or falls
// entirely on the basis of the attribute use and its {attribute declaration}".
// wildcardSubset decides cos-ns-subset over {namespace constraint}s alone and
// knows nothing of {attribute uses}, so the gate is applied HERE: the names
// clause 2.1 claims are dropped from B's {disallowed names}
// (sharedAttributeUseNames, withoutDisallowedNames) before the record is handed
// to the relation. Teaching wildcardSubset the name set instead would put
// cos-ns-subset in two encodings, which is what T4 forbids and what #262
// declined to build.
//
// The exempt set is the INTERSECTION of the two {attribute uses} sets, never
// either side alone, because the two directions are not symmetric:
//
//   - a name BOTH sides hold a use for is assessed by clause 2.1 against T AND
//     by clause 2.1 against B, so clause 2.2 fires on neither side and B's
//     {disallowed names} entry for it cannot be charged however it got there.
//     This is the shape #430 fixed: B declaring <xs:attribute name="foo"/>
//     alongside <anyAttribute namespace="##any" notQName="foo"/>, T restricting
//     it with <anyAttribute namespace="##any"/> and inheriting the foo use whole
//     (§3.4.2.4 clause 3.2, attributeusefold.go), was a FALSE REJECT of a valid
//     schema — Finalize returns this error to its caller in place of a *Schema.
//   - a name only T holds a use for is NOT exempt: c-ran clause 3 still requires
//     the item to satisfy clause 2 with respect to B, and B, having no use for
//     it, can only satisfy it through clause 2.2 — so a B whose wildcard
//     disallows that name is a genuine violation and stays charged. (The loop in
//     checkAttributeRestriction charges the same shape first, through
//     attributeDefaultBinding; this half is what holds when a caller reaches it
//     directly.)
