// This file is the M5 pull driver xsd/doc.go names: Matcher, the
// instance-guided advance of one complex type's {content type} particle, one
// child at a time. It decides Element Sequence Locally Valid (Particle)
// (§3.9.4.2, cvc-particle) — a one-clause wrapper over Element Sequence
// Accepted (Particle) (§3.9.4.3, cvc-accept) — and, through cvc-accept clause
// 3, Element Sequence Valid (§3.8.4.3, cvc-model-group) over §3.8.4.1's
// per-compositor recognition rules. The caller charges the enclosing
// cvc-complex-content (§3.4.4.3) or cvc-complex-type (§3.4.4.2) clause; nothing
// here builds an error, because "no particle admits this name" is a local
// non-match at every position but the last, and only the caller knows which
// position it is looking at.
//
// The walk COUNTS: state is one occurrence counter per particle of the
// flattened content model plus the path of particles the last item was
// ·attributed to·. No occurrence range is unfolded into copies, so
// maxOccurs="100000" costs one counter and not a hundred thousand positions —
// the opposite trade from particleattribution.go's automaton, which unfolds
// because ·compete· is a question about the MODEL and this one is a question
// about an INSTANCE. The two constructions are deliberately not shared:
// automaton.addAll accepts a documented SUPERSET of the interleave language
// (particleattribution.go), which is the right direction for a schema
// constraint and a false accept for an instance one, and its unfolding bound
// changes the accepted language outright (e{3,6} reads as e{2,4}).
//
// # One particle per item, and more than one partition
//
// The walk never re-reads an item and never undoes one it has taken
// (PRINCIPLES 14). Two facts fix WHICH PARTICLE each item goes to, and neither
// is an assumption a comment makes:
//
//   - cos-nonambig (§3.8.6.4) has run. A Matcher is reachable only through a
//     *Schema, which only SchemaBuilder.Finalize produces, and Phase C rejects
//     a content model with two ·competing· particles. So at most one ELEMENT
//     particle live in one state admits a given ·expanded name·, and the
//     particle an item is ·attributed to· is not a choice this file makes.
//   - Where an element particle and a wildcard particle both admit one name —
//     the one competition 1.1 permits (Appendix G.1.3) — cvc-accept's closing
//     Note fixes the answer: "the validation process defined in this
//     specification matches the element information item against the Element
//     Declaration, both in identifying the Element Declaration as the item's
//     ·context-determined declaration·, and in choosing alternative paths
//     through a content model". Next therefore searches the live particles for
//     an element admission first and for a wildcard admission only if that
//     search fails, which is PRINCIPLES 14's "explicit content beats a
//     wildcard" stated as a search order.
//
// Neither settles WHICH ITERATION of a repeated ancestor an item falls in, the
// third non-determinism the same Note names: "nested particles each of which
// has {max occurs} greater than 1, where the input sequence can be partitioned
// in multiple ways ... there is no fixed rule for eliminating the
// non-determinism". cvc-accept clause 3.1 asks that question EXISTENTIALLY —
// "there is a partition of the sequence into n sub-sequences" — so a sequence
// is ·accepted· where SOME partition validates, and picking one partition and
// walking it answers a different question than the rule asks. A greedy pick —
// stay in the innermost open iteration for as long as it can — gets "a a b"
// wrong against (a{1,2}, b?){2,2}, which L(P) admits as the partition (a)(a b)
// and the greedy walk consumes as one iteration and then rejects.
//
// So the walk carries a SET of the partitions of the items so far that are
// still live, and a name is taken where any of them takes it. That is not a
// search: no partition re-reads an item, none is revisited, and the set is
// widened only where the greedy order is not already exact —
//
//   - a differing partition needs one particle P reachable both later in the
//     open iteration of some repeatable ancestor R and at the start of R's next
//     iteration (two DIFFERENT particles would ·compete·, which cos-nonambig has
//     already rejected);
//   - P starting R's body means every particle before it on its path is
//     skippable, so the shorter iteration the alternative closes before P holds
//     no mandatory particle of the body — and is a word of the body's language
//     only where the body has none at all, which is to say where it is
//     ·emptiable·, where the greedy pick is exact: its iteration count is never
//     ABOVE the alternative's, so no {max occurs} it satisfies is one the greedy
//     pick exceeds, and canExit lets the iterations still owed be empty, so
//     {min occurs} is met as well. The one way that iteration can hold a
//     mandatory particle is P ITSELF, taken again, which needs a repeating
//     particle inside a repeating one;
//   - so the set splits at a node R that repeats and holds such a P
//     (contentNode.ambiguous) and nowhere else. P has to stand at BOTH ends of
//     R's iteration boundary at once — reachable as the first item of a fresh
//     iteration, which needs every particle before it skippable, and reachable
//     with the open iteration already a whole word of the body, which needs
//     every particle after it skippable — so a body holding a mandatory
//     particle on either side of each of its repeating particles never splits,
//     however wide R's own occurrence range. A model with no such node carries
//     one partition for the whole sequence and costs exactly what the greedy
//     walk cost.
//
// # What the walk carries the set AS
//
// The live partitions differ in their occurrence counters and in nothing else
// (partitionsBounded), and a counter stops at its node's {max occurs}, or at
// its {min occurs} where {max occurs} is unbounded (counterCap), because
// canRepeat, canExit and offerAllMembers are its only readers and none can tell
// a larger value from the clamp. So the set is a set of counter TUPLES, bounded
// by the SCHEMA and never by the instance.
//
// One entry per tuple is not enough. (a{1,500}){1,500} puts a quarter of a
// million partitions in flight at once — every (iterations so far, items in the
// open iteration) pair a prefix admits — and that is not an artefact of the
// bound: each pair really is reachable. The walk therefore carries a run of
// adjacent counts as one span and a tuple of spans as one region, which covers
// that width in about a thousand entries and costs one walk step each. region
// carries why one step decides a whole run at once, and partitionsBounded what
// a model's cover costs; ContentMatcher declines the models whose cover would
// outgrow maxPartitionStates, which is what makes one item's cost a constant of
// the schema rather than a function of the items already taken.
//
// # The {open content} split, and why it needs no search either
//
// Where the {content type}'s {open content} is PRESENT, cvc-complex-content
// (§3.4.4.3) clauses 2 and 3 decide the sequence S as two subsequences: an S1
// ·valid· with respect to {particle} (cvc-particle §3.9.4.2, clauses 2.2 and
// 3.2) and an S2 every member of which is ·valid· with respect to
// {open content}.{wildcard} (cvc-wildcard §3.10.4.1, clauses 2.4 and 3.4).
// Neither clause leaves the split open, so neither needs a search:
//
//   - clause 2.3 ({mode} suffix) admits an S2 only where S1 + E has no ·path·
//     in {particle} for S2's first element E (§3.8.4.1, key-path). Having a
//     path is prefix-closed, so exactly one S1 satisfies that: the longest
//     prefix of S that has one. A shorter prefix leaves 2.3 false for its own
//     first S2 item, and a longer one has no path.
//   - clause 3.3 ({mode} interleave) says the same of EVERY member E of S2,
//     against S3, the part of S1 preceding E. Each item's side is therefore
//     fixed by the items before it: {particle} takes the item wherever it can
//     extend, and the wildcard takes it only where {particle} provably cannot.
//
// That is PRINCIPLES 14's "explicit content beats an open-content wildcard at
// the current state" arriving as the clauses' own condition rather than as a
// tie-break this file invents. Next asks the two particle searches first and
// the open wildcard last, and an item the open wildcard takes leaves the walk
// state untouched, S2 being matched against that wildcard and nothing else.
// Clause 2.1's S = S1 + S2 is a concatenation, so suffix mode never offers
// {particle} another item once it has left it; clause 3.1's S1 × S2 is the
// interleave operator (§3.8.4.1.3), so interleave mode offers every item.

// Attribution is what one element information item of a matched child sequence
// is ·attributed to· (§3.4.4.4, key-att-to): the {term} of the particle
// [Matcher.Next] advanced over, or a present {open content} itself. It is a
// sealed sum (STYLE T2's closed-sum exception) with exactly three variants.
// [ElementDeclaration] (cvc-accept clause 2) and [Wildcard] (cvc-accept clause
// 1) are the two kinds of ·basic particle· an item can be attributed to — a
// Model Group is not one, and returning [Term] would make an attribution to one
// representable (STYLE T1). [*OpenContent] is the third, for an item
// cvc-complex-content clause 2.4 or 3.4 admitted, which §3.4.4.4 ·attributes
// to· the {open content} and not to any particle: the spec keeps the two apart
// throughout — §3.4.5.2 gives this case the [match information] keyword open
// where a ·wildcard particle· takes strict/lax/skip, and §3.4.6.4's
// key-dft-binding clauses 4-6 name them as alternative cases — so a consumer
// deciding a rule that quantifies over particles alone can decide it here.
//
// An [ElementDeclaration] result is the particle's own declaration D, which is
// the answer to "which particle consumed this item". For an item admitted
// through cvc-accept clause 2.3.2 the ·context-determined declaration· is the
// ·substituting declaration· S and not D; resolving S is the recursive
// assessment's job (§3.3.4.6), not this one's.
//
// A [Wildcard] result is the {term} of a ·wildcard particle· (§3.9.1, key-wp)
// and never the {wildcard} of an {open content}. That is the distinction
// e-validity clause 1.1.3 (§3.3.5.1) turns on: it quantifies over an item
// ·attributed to· a ***strict*** ·wildcard particle· and names no other
// component, so this arm decides it and the [*OpenContent] one does not.
//
// An [*OpenContent] result is the {open content} record of the {content type}
// being matched — never nil, and the same pointer [ElementContent] carries, so
// a consumer may compare it by identity as well as read {mode} and {wildcard}
// off it. A switch arm may therefore dereference it without a nil check:
// [Matcher.Next] reports no match at all where the {open content} is ·absent·.

//
// The two declines, none of them a violation:
//
//   - a {content type} whose {variety} is empty or simple, which holds no
//     particle at all. cvc-complex-type clauses 1.1 and 1.2 govern those
//     directly and need no matcher.
//   - GAP(xsd): an ·ambiguous· node whose widened subtrees need more than
//     maxPartitionStates regions to cover the partitions they put in flight at
//     once. RULED permanent by #1601 (STYLE P3b) rather than a ceiling waiting
//     on its next raise: that thread carries the ruling in full, and it rests
//     on the measured cost below rather than on a spec licence. No spec licence
//     covers this branch and this marker claims none — cvc-accept (§3.9.4.3)
//     clause 3.1 is a bare existential over ·partitions· with no search
//     procedure and no bound, §3.9.4.1.1's L(P) attaches none either, and
//     neither Appendix C nor Appendix E.1's implementation-defined checklist
//     lets a processor decline what it cannot afford. The SHAPE is decided —
//     (a{1,2}, b?){2,2} takes "a a b" — and so now is the WIDTH a
//     partition-per-cursor encoding could not carry: (a{1,500}){1,500} reaches
//     a quarter of a million live partitions and the spans of a region cover
//     them in about a thousand. What stays declined is what outgrows the
//     ceiling, and a model gets there by BREADTH as readily as by depth:
//     partitionsBounded products over EVERY widened node of the flattened tree,
//     so sibling repeating groups under a non-repeating one, and a row of
//     repeating leaves under one repeating group, reach it with no nesting at
//     all. Declining withholds the whole element-sequence verdict, whose
//     consumers are validate's Result.violations and its one reader
//     Result.Violations, both of which carry violations PRESENT — so the
//     decline costs a rejection and manufactures none. What makes the
//     approximation permanent is the distance between the ceiling and what
//     still reaches it. A walk over every buildable complex type in
//     testdata/xsdtests finds THREE declining here, all on this arm —
//     particlesZ035_a, particlesZ036_b and particlesZ036_c — and each carries
//     one model-group counter whose clamped range ALONE outruns the ceiling,
//     past 10^8 in the two Z036s and past 10^11 in Z035_a. A single factor with
//     no room ends the count, so deciding them means a per-item budget of that
//     many regions: at the ≈1.5 KB per region maxPartitionStates' doc measures,
//     over a hundred gigabytes and over a hundred terabytes for ONE item. Four
//     instance cases sit on those three, all banked fail, and three of the four
//     are suite-declared VALID and cannot flip on that lane whatever the
//     ceiling (#1561) — so what the residual costs the suite is one missed
//     rejection, particlesZ035_a.i. It is retired by an encoding that carries a
//     live partition set without enumerating its cover, never by moving the
//     constant. Two findings reopen the ruling, and a case merely declining
//     here is neither, since three already do. One is a schema whose
//     partitionsBounded product lands BETWEEN the ceiling and what a measured
//     per-region cost can afford — the plateau above 40804 is empty today, so a
//     model in it would mean a raise buys verdicts again. The other is a
//     per-region cost measured low enough to bring one of the three counters
//     named above inside an affordable ceiling. Re-measure rather than quoting
//     these figures: the instrument is that corpus walk over buildable complex
//     types, not suiteindex, which cannot reach a population defined by a

// measured here justifies — would decide it. No ceiling between 40804 and that
// tail buys another case, so every one of them decides the same four instance

// # Why the counters are the whole of what varies
//
// Every live partition stands at the same ·basic particle·. Two that did not
// would ·compete· for the name that put them there — key-compete (§3.8.4.2)
// calls two particles competing when one sequence has two ·paths· identical but
// for their last item, which is exactly two live partitions taking one name to
// different particles — and cos-nonambig (§3.8.6.4) forbids a content model to
// contain two ·element particles· or two ·wildcard particles· that compete.
// Finalize has already decided cos-nonambig, so live partitions differ ONLY in
// the occurrence counters an ·ambiguous· node's iteration boundary moves, which
// are its own and its subtree's (markWidened). The flattened model is a tree,
// so the same particle is reached by one path; a whole live set therefore shares
// one path and is covered by regions over counters alone.
//
// # What a widened counter costs in regions
//
// Both factors below are an ESTIMATE of the cover, not a bound on the
// partitions: the walk's verdicts do not depend on either being tight, only on
// the budget one item is allowed to spend (maxPartitionStates).
//
//   - A model group's counter is an ITERATION count, and repeat clears the
//     subtree beneath it, so two live partitions that differ in it stand in
//     unrelated positions of the body and no span merges them. It costs its
//     whole clamped range, counterCap+1, as it did when every partition carried
//     its own cursor.
//   - A leaf's counter advances by ONE per item inside the open iteration, so
//     the partitions that differ only in where the last iteration boundary fell
//     inside that leaf's own run of items cover in one span. The boundary can
//     only fall where the items after it are still a word of the body, which
//     pins it to a run per leaf and not to a position per item — so the leaf
//     costs its band count (bandCount), which is at most four however wide its
//     occurrence range.
//
// Both factors are at most counterCap+1, the cursor-per-partition count this
// walk bounded before, so no model that was carried then is declined now.
//
// The product is of {max occurs} values and would overflow for a model that
// combines large ones, so it is never formed: each factor is checked against
// the room the running product leaves, and a factor with no room ends the count
// at once.
