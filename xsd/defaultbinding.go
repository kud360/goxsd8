// This file renders two §3.4.6.4 definitions statically over the component
// model: ·default binding· (key-dft-binding) and ·subsumes· (loc-testSubP).
//
// Both are worded over INFORMATION ITEMS at assessment time. Their ATTRIBUTE
// half is nonetheless decidable per (Complex Type Definition, expanded name)
// without any instance, and that static rendering is the whole of what
// derivation-ok-restriction clause 3 (c-ran) needs: the clause quantifies over
// every element information item whose attributes are valid against T, which for
// attributes reduces to "for each expanded name T admits, compare the bindings".
//
// The ELEMENT half (key-dft-binding case 1, loc-testSubP clause 4) is
// cos-content-act-restrict's business (derivation-ok-restriction clause 2.4.2)
// and lives here too, but is reached from contentrestricts.go rather than from
// this file: that constraint walks a content model to learn WHICH declaration or
// wildcard an item binds to, while the two halves share the ·subsumes· relation
// below. The two entry points differ only in what they return — the attribute
// half charges an error per sub-clause, the element half answers a bool, because
// it is one conjunct of derivation-ok-restriction clause 2's disjunction and so
// is not yet a verdict where it is evaluated. The wildcard-bucket lattice
// (clauses 1-3) has ONE encoding, keywordSubsumes, which both reach (STYLE T4).

// defaultBinding is the ·default binding· a Content Type or Complex Type
// Definition gives an information item (Structures §3.4.6.4, key-dft-binding):
// "an Element Declaration, an Attribute Use, or one of the keywords strict, lax,
// or skip". The spec's six cases land in exactly those three shapes, so the set
// is closed and this is a sealed sum (STYLE T2) mirroring ContentType and
// Term — never a kind tag beside optional payloads, which would make "an
// Element Declaration that is also skip" representable.

// element declaration·, and the binding is that Element Declaration. It is

// qualifier), so the binding is the keyword itself. The keyword is the already

// wildcard} of a Complex Type Definition, or of an Attribute Group Definition
// src-redefine clause 7.2.2 instructs be read as one:
//
//   - case 2: the member of side's {attribute uses} whose {attribute declaration}
//     carries n. For a complex type the property is the MATERIALISED one
//     (§3.4.2.4 clause 3, attributeusefold.go), so an INHERITED use counts
//     without any walk here. cvc-complex-type clause 2.1 makes such a use the
//     ·context-determined declaration·, so it wins over any wildcard — including
//     a wildcard on the same side, since case 2 is tested before cases 4/5/6. The
//     set is exact for both derivation methods: clause 3.2.2's prohibited names
//     are applied at the fold too, so a name a restriction prohibits is absent
//     here rather than reported as the ancestor's use.
//   - cases 4/5/6: otherwise, if side's {attribute wildcard} admits n, the
//     wildcard's {process contents} keyword. This one is read off that side
//     ALONE, and that is exact for both derivation methods: the property is the
//     MATERIALISED one (§3.4.2.5 clause 2, attributewildcardfold.go), so a
//     restriction carries its own ·complete wildcard· (clause 2.1) and an
//     extension carries the cos-aw-union of its own with its base's (clause 2.2)
//     without any walk here.
//
// ok is false when side admits no attribute of that name at all — no member of
// {attribute uses} and no admitting wildcard — in which case there is no binding
// to compare and the CALLER charges the failure. Case 1 (·governing element
// declaration·) is the element half and is not reachable here.
//
// GAP(xsd): case 3 — the item has a ·governing attribute declaration· and is
// ·attributed· to an attribute wildcard, so the binding is a SYNTHESIZED
// Attribute Use over that declaration — is not rendered, and the wildcard branch
// falls through to the keyword instead. Whether an attribute HAS a ·governing
// attribute declaration· is an assessment-episode fact (key-governing-ad clause
// 3 resolves it by expanded name at ·assessment· time, against the schema of a
// real episode rather than this document graph — cvc-resolve-instance,
// §3.17.6.3 — and clause 1 lets the processor stipulate one outright); a static
// schema check cannot fix it, and guessing "a top-level declaration of that name
// exists, so case 3 applies" makes an unrelated global declaration silently
// constrain a restriction's local attribute type. RULED permanent by #267 (STYLE
// P3b): no schema shape can conclude that case 3 APPLIES, and the real case-3
// binding is the instance validator's to render, with the assessed item and its
// ·resolution· in hand (validate/doc.go's M5 contract).
//
// Falling through to the keyword is FAIL-OPEN against both readers of this
// function's result, both of them in checkAttributeRestriction
// (attributerestriction.go). checkBindingSubsumes charges c-ran clause 3 only
// where the base binding does NOT ·subsume· the restriction's, and a keyword G
// as keywordSubsumes below renders it accepts every specific binding a case-3
// Attribute Use G would accept and more — the pairings it charges, lax against
// skip and strict against skip or against a ##defined lax, an Attribute Use G
// charges too, through checkBindingSubsumes' catch-all — so the substitution
// can only turn a charge into an acceptance, never a false reject. The other
// reader, that caller's ok=false charge, is unaffected in either direction:
// name admission alone decides it, before any binding is built.
//
// The gap is NARROWER than the whole wildcard branch: it is every attribute
// wildcard whose {process contents} is strict or lax AND whose {namespace
// constraint}.{disallowed names} does NOT contain the keyword defined. Two
// wildcard shapes fall statically outside case 3, each by its own argument, and
// for them the keyword returned below is the EXACT key-dft-binding rather than
// an approximation of it — modulo clause 1's stipulation, which is an external
// input to an assessment episode that this schema-authoring-time constraint
// sets aside wherever it reads a binding.
//
//   - {process contents} skip. key-governing-ad clause 3 resolves by expanded
//     name only "provided the attribute is not ·skipped·", and key-skipped
//     (§3.10.4.1) makes an item ·attributed· to a skip wildcard ·skipped·.
//     Clause 2 is unavailable to any wildcard-attributed item at all — that
//     section's closing Note gives such an item no ·context-determined
//     declaration·, and states outright that a skip {process contents} leaves
//     it no ·governing· declaration. validate/cvcid.go's skippedAttribute is
//     this repo's one encoding of that reading, and the place to read it from.
//     key-dft-binding's own drafting agrees: cases 4 and 5 are each
//     qualified "and it does not have a ·governing ... declaration·" and case 6
//     is not, the exclusion being already guaranteed there.
//   - {disallowed names} containing defined (notQName="##defined", §3.10.2).
//     cvc-wildcard (§3.10.4.1) clause 2.2 makes "the expanded name does not
//     ·resolve· to an attribute declaration" a PRECONDITION of valid
//     attribution to that wildcard, so an item ·attributed· to it can have no
//     key-governing-ad clause-3 declaration either. AllowsAttributeWildcardName
//     (wildcardadmit.go) is what makes this exact rather than merely probable:
//     it decides clause 2.2 itself, so for a ##defined wildcard and a name the
//     schema declares at top level the return below is unreachable.
//
// Every subset returns the same wildcardKeywordBinding, so nothing here
