// This file decides the two Effective Total Range Schema Component Constraints —
// Effective Total Range (all and sequence) (Structures §3.8.6.5, cos-seq-range)
// and Effective Total Range (choice) (§3.8.6.6, cos-choice-range) — together with
// the ·emptiable· definition that reads them, Particle Emptiable (§3.9.6.3,
// cos-group-emptiable).
//
// None of the three is a rejection point of its own: an effective total range is
// a DERIVED pair and ·emptiable· is a predicate over it. Both are consumed by
// derivation-ok-restriction clauses 2.2.2.2 and 2.3.2.2 (complexderivation.go),
// which charge the failure with the rule the spec names there.
//
// NOT THE SAME NOTION as particleattribution.go's `emptiable`, and the two must
// never be collapsed into one helper: that one is "can this automaton fragment
// accept the empty sequence", built for Unique Particle Attribution, and it and
// this one genuinely DISAGREE on an empty <choice>. particleattribution.go's
// addChoice reports an empty <choice> as NOT emptiable ("accepts nothing at
// all"), while cos-choice-range's "(or 0 if there are no {particles})" makes its
// effective-total-range minimum 0 and hence the particle ·emptiable· under
// cos-group-emptiable clause 2. Both readings are right for their own rule.
//
// The walk below follows ModelGroupRef edges into their definitions with NO
// cycle guard. That is licensed, not overlooked: it runs only in Phase D
// (resolve.go), strictly after Phase B's checkModelGroupsAcyclic has rejected a
// circular <group ref> graph (PRINCIPLES 5).

// maxFiniteRange caps the saturating arithmetic below. An effective total range
// is a product of a particle's {min occurs}/{max occurs} with a sum over its
// group's members, so nesting a handful of maxOccurs="100000" groups overflows
// int. Saturating is sound because NO consumer of an effective total range
// distinguishes one large finite value from another: particleEmptiable asks only
// whether the minimum is 0, and the maximum rule asks only whether a value is
// unbounded or non-zero. Wrapping, by contrast, could turn a huge positive
// minimum into 0 and make a non-emptiable particle look ·emptiable· — the one
// failure mode that matters, since it would ACCEPT a restriction the spec
// rejects. Capping has precedent in this package (maxMandatoryCopies /
// maxOptionalCopies, particleattribution.go).

// effectiveRange is the ·effective total range· of a particle: the (minimum,

// It is deliberately NOT xsd.Occurs. Occurs is a PARTICLE'S {min occurs}/{max
// occurs} property pair (§3.9.1) whose constructors charge p-props-correct; an
// effective total range is a derived quantity that is no particle's property, so
// reusing Occurs would make a computed range assignable to a real {min
// occurs}/{max occurs} slot and force every step of the recursion below through
// an error-returning constructor for an arithmetically impossible failure. The
// unbounded fact keeps ONE encoding across both types, though: max carries
// occurs.go's unboundedMax sentinel (STYLE D3).
//
// There is no validating constructor because there is nothing to validate:
// min <= max is a theorem of the arithmetic (sums, minima and maxima of
// non-negative bounds all preserve it), not an invariant a caller could break.

// mistake these two near-identical constraints invite, so the aggregation lives
// in exactly one place (aggregateRanges) keyed on the compositor.
//
// maximum: ***unbounded*** if any member's maximum is unbounded, OR if some
// member's maximum is NON-ZERO and P.{max occurs} is unbounded; otherwise the
// product of P.{max occurs} and — over the members — the SUM for all/sequence or
// the MAXIMUM for choice, or 0 when the group has no {particles}. The
