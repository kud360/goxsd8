// This file answers ·substitution group· membership (§3.3.6.4, key-eq) — "is the
// element declaration named member ·substitutable· for the one named head?" — for
// the finalize-phase consumers that ask it: cvc-wildcard clause 3's ·implicit·
// containment (wildcardadmit.go), cos-content-act-restrict's ·element particle·
// admission (contentrestricts.go), cos-nonambig's ·overlap· relation
// (particleattribution.go), and cos-element-consistent's ·implicitly contains·
// (elementconsistent.go). It was lifted out of wildcardadmit.go, whose subject is
// wildcards, once the second and third consumers appeared (STYLE T4/T5).
//
// It exposes ONE predicate, and that predicate is EXACT: Substitution Group OK
// (Transitive) (§3.3.6.3, cos-equiv-derived-ok-rec) is decided in full, clause 1
// (same declaration), clause 2.1 ({disallowed substitutions}), clause 2.2 (the
// {substitution group affiliations} chain) and clause 2.3 (the ·derivation·
// blocking test) alike. Consumers therefore need no approximation direction: the
// answer is the spec's answer whichever polarity the calling constraint reads it
// in — one that DISALLOWS a name on membership (cvc-wildcard clause 3) and one
// that FIRES a schema component constraint on it (cos-nonambig,
// cos-element-consistent) both get the same true relation.
//
// Two walks run here, over two different edge kinds, and each terminates on its
// own licence (PRINCIPLES 9, no runtime cycle checks):
//
//   - the {substitution group affiliations} walk (clause 2.2) terminates because
//     Finalize's Phase B ran checkSubstitutionGroupsAcyclic (e-props-correct
//     clause 5) and rejected a circular affiliation graph, so the graph is
//     acyclic by construction on any *Schema that exists;
//   - the {base type definition} walk (clause 2.3) terminates because Phase B
//     also ran checkComplexBaseAcyclic (ct-props-correct clause 3), plus an
//     explicit xs:anyType test for the one self-based type §3.4.7 permits —
//     exactly the licence derivedOKComplex's walk records (complexderivation.go).
//     Where that walk crosses into the simple-type chain it needs no check at
//     all: a *SimpleType takes its {base type definition} as an already-built
//     component, so a cycle is unconstructible (simpletype.go records
//     st-props-correct clause 2 as a no-op for that reason) and the chain ends
//     at xs:anySimpleType, whose base is nil.

// inSubstitutionGroupOf reports whether the element declaration named member is
// in the ·substitution group· of the one named head (§3.3.6.4, key-eq: "An
// element declaration is in the ·substitution group· of HEAD if and only if it is
// ·substitutable· for HEAD"), i.e. whether the two satisfy Substitution Group OK
// (Transitive) (§3.3.6.3, cos-equiv-derived-ok-rec):
//
//   - clause 1: M and H are the same element declaration. Name equality IS
//     component identity for these two operands: both name entries of {element
//     declarations}, which sch-props-correct clause 2 keeps unique by expanded
//     name. Folding it in is what makes this the ·substitution group· relation
//     rather than its irreflexive part — HEAD is always in its own group;
//   - clause 2.1: head's {disallowed substitutions} must not contain
//     substitution. The rule tests HEAD's property only — intermediate
//     declarations on the affiliation chain are not consulted, and the spec says
//     "intermediate" only in clause 2.3, about type definitions;
//   - clause 2.2: there is a chain of {substitution group affiliations} from
//     member to head;
//   - clause 2.3: the ·derivation· of member's {type definition} from head's is
//     not blocked (derivationAdmitsSubstitution).
//
// {abstract} plays NO part: it appears nowhere in cos-equiv-derived-ok-rec, so an
// abstract declaration genuinely in the substitution group still counts.
//
// Membership is decided by walking the affiliation chain UPWARD from member (one
// index point lookup per hop), not by scanning {element declarations} for every
// member of head's group: the question here is membership of ONE name, and the
// upward walk answers exactly that. No map is ever ranged, and no iteration order
// reaches the result (STYLE D2).

// derivationAdmitsSubstitution is cos-equiv-derived-ok-rec clause 2.3: "The set
// of all {derivation method}s involved in the ·derivation· of M.{type definition}
// from H.{type definition} does not intersect with the union of (1)
// H.{disallowed substitutions}, (2) H.{type definition}.{prohibited
// substitutions} (if H.{type definition} is complex, otherwise the empty set),
// and (3) the {prohibited substitutions} (respectively the empty set) of any
// intermediate declared {type definition}s in the ·derivation· of M.{type
// definition} from H.{type definition}."
//
// The ·derivation· (§2.2.1.1, key-derived: "If a type definition D can reach a
// type definition B by following its base type definition chain, then D is said
// to be derived from B") is walked from M.{type definition} up the {base type
// definition} chain to H.{type definition}. Each step contributes the {derivation
// method} of the type STEPPED FROM, which is the same shape cos-ct-derived-ok's
// walk has (§3.4.6.5, derivedOKComplex): every level except the terminal target
// is read. {derivation method} and {prohibited substitutions} are Complex Type
// Definition properties (§3.4.1) — a simple type on the chain has neither and so
// contributes nothing to either set, but the walk CONTINUES THROUGH it rather
// than stopping there: key-derived follows the {base type definition} chain
// whatever kind the current type is, and a simple type has a base too. So a
// complex type based on a simple one (the <simpleContent> shape) still reaches
// an H.{type definition} sitting further up the simple chain, and the
// {derivation method}s collected below it are genuinely involved in that
// ·derivation·.
//
// The two sets are both collected before either is read: an intermediate type's
// {prohibited substitutions} blocks a {derivation method} contributed FURTHER
// DOWN the chain, so no incremental per-step test would be equivalent.
//
// Clause 2.3 is a BLOCKING clause, and a ·derivation· that does not exist blocks
// nothing: when the chain ends without reaching H.{type definition} the set of
// involved {derivation method}s is empty and so is the intersection, and this
// predicate is deliberately SILENT — reading clause 2.3 as requiring the chain
// would be legislating a different rule. The same reading covers an absent or
// unresolvable {type definition} on either side, which declaredTypeRestricts
// (defaultbinding.go) skips identically: there is no component to walk, and a
// dangling name was already charged src-resolve by resolve.go's Phase A.
//
// GAP(xsd): requiring the chain to exist at all belongs to e-props-correct
// clause 4 (§3.3.6.1, c-vs-sg: "For each member M of E.{substitution group
// affiliations}, E.{type definition} is ·validly substitutable· for M.{type
// definition}, subject to the blocking keywords in M.{substitution group
// exclusions}"), and NOTHING in this package enforces it: no check function
// implements clause 4, and {substitution group exclusions}, the property it
// reads, is stored and exposed but consulted by no constraint. A member whose
// {type definition} does not ·derive· from its head's is therefore accepted
// today. Do not read the silence above as delegation to a check that exists; it
// is an unimplemented rule, recorded in the #249 arbiter review.
//
// EVERY step is reached through typeOf, the package's one type-slot reader
// (STYLE T4) — the starting {type definition} and each {base type definition}
// after it — so an ANONYMOUS type participates in the walk rather than ending
// it. That matters in both directions: an anonymous inline type is M's own first
// step, and the anonymous src-expredef clause 1.1 original a redefining complex
// type owns is an intermediate step. Ending the walk on one would return TRUE, a
// fail-OPEN accept and not a conservative refusal (#505). No map is ranged
// (STYLE D2). An anonymous H.{type definition} can end the walk only by being
// M.{type definition} itself, since sameTypeDefinition reports two anonymous
// types as distinct on the licence §3.4.6.5's no-identity Note grants.
